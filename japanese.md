# Lesson 1: The core Japanese sentence

Every Japanese sentence is fundamentally the same, they have the same core.

Every sentence is formed of two elements, (visualised as a train) they are the *carriage* and *engine*.

In all languages there are only two kinds of sentence:

-   A is B: Sakura is Japanese
-   A does B: Sakura Walks

Sakura ga nihonjin da - Sakira is Japanese
Sakura ga aruku - Sakura walks

Going back to the train metaphor:
 *Carriage*      *Engine*
[Sakura \*が\*] [Nihonjin \*だ\*]

There is a form of the Japanese sentence core sentence:
*Carriage*  *Engine*
[Pen \*が\*] [aka \*い\*] = Pen is red
This is similar, but not identical to an adjective. This will be discussed more later.

To recap, all of these sentences begin with the subject, they are connected with が, and the three *engines* of the Japanese core sentence are:

-   う - verb          - A does B
-   だ - noun          - A is B
-   い - *&ldquo;adjective&rdquo;* - A is B

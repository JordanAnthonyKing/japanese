# Lesson 1: The core Japanese sentence

Every Japanese sentence is fundamentally the same, they have the same core.

Every sentence is formed of two elements, (visualised as a train) they are the *carriage* and *engine*.

In all languages there are only two kinds of sentence:

-   A **is** B: Sakura is Japanese
-   A **does** B: Sakura Walks

> Sakura ga nihonjin da - Sakura is Japanese

> Sakura ga aruku - Sakura walks

Going back to the train metaphor:

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="org-left" />

<col  class="org-left" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="org-left">Carriage</td>
<td class="org-left">Engine</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="org-left">Sakura <b>が</b></td>
<td class="org-left">Nihonjin <b>だ</b></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="org-left" />

<col  class="org-left" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="org-left">Carriage</td>
<td class="org-left">Engine</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="org-left">Pen <b>が</b></td>
<td class="org-left">Aka <b>い</b></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

To recap, all of these sentences begin with the subject, they are connected with が, and the three *engines* of the Japanese core sentence are:

-   う - verb          - A does B
-   だ - noun          - A is B
-   い - *&ldquo;adjective&rdquo;* - A is B

# Lesson 2: Invisible が and the を-particle


<a id="orgefa09ab"></a>

## The invisible が carriage

Part of the reason so many people struggle with Japanese is that, although we can always see the *engine* of the sentence, we cannot always see the が carriage. Remember, the core of the Japanese sentence is formed of the が carriage and an engine.

The closest English equivalent to this invisible が carriage is &rsquo;it&rsquo;. Here is an example English sentence:

> The ball rolled down the hill. When the ball got to the bottom the ball hit a sharp stone and the ball was punctured and all the air came out of the ball.

This is not a sentence we would ever say in English, once we have established that we are talking about &rsquo;the ball&rsquo; we would instead refer to the ball by &rsquo;it&rsquo;:

> The ball rolled down the hill. When it got to the bottom it hit a sharp stone and it was punctured and all the air came out of it.

If we were to completely omit &rsquo;it&rsquo; the sentence would still be easy to understand, we don&rsquo;t **need** to use this it marker each time, but English grammar **demands** it. Japanese does not, hence the &rsquo;invisible&rsquo; が carriage.

&rsquo;It&rsquo; by itself doesn&rsquo;t really mean anything, we know what it means from context. If a child comes downstairs in the middle of the night and says *&rsquo;Got really hungry&rsquo;*, *&rsquo;Came for something to eat&rsquo;* we understand that the child means *&rsquo;I got really hungry&rsquo;* not *&rsquo;The dog got really hungry&rsquo;*. In English this isn&rsquo;t a proper sentence, but in Japanese it is.

All of the little pronouns I/it/we/he/they can all be replaced by the invisible が carriage; the *∅ pronoun*. It is important to remember that the carriage **is still there**.

One might say: 「ドリーだ」 meaning *&rsquo;I am Dolly&rsquo;*. The full sentence being: 「∅がドリーだ」.

By default &rsquo;I&rsquo; is the default value of this *∅ pronoun*. However, if someone were introducing their daughter and said 「ドリーだ」 we would understand from context that ∅ meant this/she.

If I say 「土曜日だ」 - *&rsquo;It is Saturday&rsquo;* it is clear that 「∅が」 is *today*.

Each of these sentences are complete grammatical sentences with a subject marked by が and an engine, but in each of these cases the が carriage is just invisible. It **is** still there. This may seem to be arbitrary, or over-complicated but it saves a lot of grief later on to model sentences this way. Without this information as sentences become more complex they&rsquo;re going to seem increasingly vague and hard to understand.


<a id="orgee25fa0"></a>

## The を-particle

This carriage is formed of a noun and the particle を. The を particle marks the object of the sentence. The thing that some verb (the engine) is being done to (が marks the thing doing the verb). It is not part of the core sentence which is always formed of the が carriage and an engine.

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="org-left" />

<col  class="org-left" />

<col  class="org-left" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="org-left">Carriage</td>
<td class="org-left">Carriage</td>
<td class="org-left">Engine</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="org-left">わたし*が*</td>
<td class="org-left">ケエキ*を*</td>
<td class="org-left">たべ*る*</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="org-left">I</td>
<td class="org-left">cake</td>
<td class="org-left">eat</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The core sentence here is &rsquo;I eat&rsquo;. The extra carriage, the を carriage is telling us more about the engine. *What* are we eating? We are eating cake.

Once again, we would often see this said as 「ケーキをたべる」. This is just another case of the invisible が carriage. We **cannot** have a sentence without a が - we **cannot** have a sentence without a doer.

When we are saying 「ケーキをたべる」, what we are really saying is 「∅がケーキをたべる」. And the default value for ∅ is 「わたし」 - &rsquo;I&rsquo;.


<a id="org555911c"></a>

# Lesson 3: は-particle and に-particle


<a id="org327ef1b"></a>

## は particle

The は-particle can never be a part of the core Japanese sentence. It is neither the carriage we are saying something about, nor the engine i.e. what we are saying about it. It isn&rsquo;t a carriage *outside* of the core sentence either like the を-particle is. The は-particle is not part of the logical structure of the sentence.

は is a non-logical particle. In our train metaphor the は-particle is a *flag*. It simply marks something as the topic of the sentence, but doesn&rsquo;t say anything about it.

An exact translation of the は particle would be &rsquo;As for *x*&rsquo;. 「わたしは」 therefore means &rsquo;As for me&rsquo;, **not** &rsquo;I am&rsquo; (わたしが).

A commonly mistranslated sentence is:

> わたしは日本人だ - I am Japanese

If we look back at our train however we can see that something is missing:

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="org-left" />

<col  class="org-left" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="org-left">Flag</td>
<td class="org-left">Engine</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="org-left">わたし*は*</td>
<td class="org-left">日本人だ</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

There is no が carriage. We don&rsquo;t know who the subject actually is. One may ask *&rsquo;well why don&rsquo;t we just treat the は particle as if it is a carriage&rsquo;*. In this example it is obvious that the topic marked by は is the same as the subject marked by が, but there are many more cases where this is not true, leading to much confusion down the road. Let&rsquo;s look at a similar sentence. You are at a restaurant, the waitress is asking what you would like:

> わたしはうなぎだ - <del>I am an eel</del>

Treating は as &rsquo;I am&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t work. As we now know the default value of the ∅ pronoun is &rsquo;I&rsquo;, but in this context it&rsquo;s clear that we&rsquo;re talking instead about *what* we want to eat. 「わたしはうなぎだ」 therefore means &rsquo;As for me, eel&rsquo;.


<a id="orge84b20f"></a>

## The に particle

The に-particle marks the target (indirect object) of an engine. Along with the が and を we have a sort of *trio* of logical *A does B* sentences:

-   が tells us who does the doing
-   を tells us what it is done to
-   に tells us what the ultimate target of that doing

> わたしがぼーるをなげる - I threw the ball

The **core** sentence is &rsquo;I threw&rsquo;, and the extra carriage (を) tells us what we threw i.e. the ball.

We can add another carriage to tell us more about the engine:

> わたしがぼーるをさくら\*に\*なげる - I threw the ball at/to Sakura

Sakura is the destination, the target. It is important to note here that the logical particles tell us what happened. The order of the words doesn&rsquo;t really matter the way it does in English.

> わたし\*に\*さくらがぼーるをなげる - Sakura threw the ball at/to me.

> ぼーるがわたし\*に\*さくらをなげる - The ball throws Sakura at me

Obviously this final example doesn&rsquo;t make any sense (although we might want to say something nonsensical like this in a fantasy novel or something) but we can say whatever we like in Japanese so long as we use the right logical particles.

Now let&rsquo;s introduce は:

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="org-left" />

<col  class="org-left" />

<col  class="org-left" />

<col  class="org-left" />

<col  class="org-left" />

<col  class="org-left" />

<col  class="org-left" />

<col  class="org-left" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="org-left">flag</td>
<td class="org-left">carriage</td>
<td class="org-left">&#xa0;</td>
<td class="org-left">carriage</td>
<td class="org-left">&#xa0;</td>
<td class="org-left">carriage</td>
<td class="org-left">&#xa0;</td>
<td class="org-left">engine</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="org-left">わたし*は*</td>
<td class="org-left">∅*が*</td>
<td class="org-left">&#xa0;</td>
<td class="org-left">さくら*に*</td>
<td class="org-left">&#xa0;</td>
<td class="org-left">ぼーる*を*</td>
<td class="org-left">&#xa0;</td>
<td class="org-left">なげ*る*</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

As we know, even if the が carriage is invisible (or silent) this means &rsquo;As for me, (I) threw the ball at Sakura&rsquo;. Now let&rsquo;s give the は *flag* to the ball:

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="org-left" />

<col  class="org-left" />

<col  class="org-left" />

<col  class="org-left" />

<col  class="org-left" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="org-left">flag</td>
<td class="org-left">carriage</td>
<td class="org-left">carriage</td>
<td class="org-left">carriage</td>
<td class="org-left">engine</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="org-left">ぼーる*は*</td>
<td class="org-left">わたし*が*</td>
<td class="org-left">さくら*に*</td>
<td class="org-left">∅*を*</td>
<td class="org-left">なげ*る*</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

As for the ball, I threw it (the ball) at Sakura.

This time the を carriage has become invisible, because what we&rsquo;re throwing is now marked by the は particle, ∅ here has taken the value of &rsquo;it&rsquo;. Even without は we might already know what &rsquo;it&rsquo; was that was thrown from context. The important thing to understand here is that as we change the logical particles from one noun to another we change the meaning of the sentence, but when we change the non-logical particle は from one noun to another it makes no difference to the logic of the sentence. It may make some difference to the emphasis, but it makes no difference to who is doing what or what they&rsquo;re doing it to.

# Lesson 4: Japanese past, present and future tenses

Up until now we&rsquo;ve only been using one tense and that is the one presented by the plain dictionary form of verbs. To use natural sounding Japanese we need 3 tenses. In Japanese these are not the same past, present and future tenses we&rsquo;re familiar with from English.

The tense we have been using thus far is **not** the present tense. It is the *non-past* tense. This non-past tense is actually very similar to the English non-past tense. What is the *English* non-past tense? It is again the plain dictionary form of a verb. Eat, run, walk etc. It is unnatural in English to say &rsquo;I eat cake&rsquo;, to mean &rsquo;I am eating cake&rsquo;. It is natural however to use the non-past tense to say &rsquo;Sometimes I eat cake&rsquo; or, in the explicitly future tense &rsquo;I will eat cake&rsquo;. Japanese is just the same as English in this way. It is rare we use this form for talking about things actually happening right now, except in cases like literary descriptions.

Most of the time the Japanese non-past tense refers to future events. In fact, just as ∅ defaults to &rsquo;I&rsquo;, the non-past tense defaults to the future.

> さくらが歩く - Sakura will walk

> 犬がたべる - Dog will eat

The way we have been using this tense up until now i.e. *&rsquo;Sakura walks&rsquo;*, is possible, but isn&rsquo;t the most natural way.

If we want to say something more natural like *&rsquo;Sakura is walking&rsquo;* we must use the verb *&rsquo;to be&rsquo;*<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>, or in Japanese 「いる」:

> さくらが歩いている - Sakura is walking

> 犬がたべている - Dog is eating

There is something here however that we haven&rsquo;t yet seen. In our train metaphor this is a *secondary engine*, here 「たべて」 which could be an engine in of itself, is helping (modifying) the main 「いる」 engine. Our core sentence is still the same, we have a が carriage and an engine, 「いる」 i.e. 「さくらがいる」 - Sakura is (existing). The secondary engine modifies 「いる」 telling us more about what state she is currently existing in, she is in the eating state. As we go further into Japanese we will see this secondary engine structure again and again.

</table>

Also, just as in English we don&rsquo;t say &rsquo;The dog is eat&rsquo;, we use a special form of the verb *eat* => *eating*. In Japanese this is the て form. This is covered in the next lesson.

For the past tense of verbs instead of adding て to verbs we add た.

> 犬がたべた - The dog ate

The way in which we do this is exactly the same as the way in which we attach て and will be covered in the next lesson.

If we want to make it clear that we are talking about a future event we can add a time expression. By prefixing a sentence with あした (tomorrow), we can make it clear that what we will be doing, we will be doing tomorrow.

> あした∅がケーキをたべる - Tomorrow I will eat cake

Note how we simply preface the sentence with &rsquo;tomorrow&rsquo;, just like we would in English. This is the case with all *relative-time nouns*, &rsquo;yesterday&rsquo;, &rsquo;tomorrow&rsquo;, &rsquo;the day after tomorrow&rsquo;, &rsquo;next week&rsquo;, next month&rsquo;, &rsquo;next year&rsquo;.

For *non-relative*, i.e. *absolute* time expressions we must use the に-particle:

> 火曜日\*に\*∅がケーキをたべる - On Tuesday I will eat cake

We must attach に in all the same places we would attach on/in/at in English. &rsquo;On Tuesday&rsquo;, &rsquo;in March&rsquo;, &rsquo;at 12 o&rsquo;clock&rsquo;. Fortunately in Japanese we only need to use the one particle.

# Lesson 5: Japanese verb groups and て-form

Japanese verbs fall into three groups: *Ichidan*, *Godan*, and *irregular*

The first group are *ichidan* (lit: one level) verbs. Morphing these verbs is easy, we simply remove the る and add our new ending. Ichidan verbs can only end in either いる or える (phonetically).

The second group is by far the largest, the *godan* (lit: five level) verbs. This group contains verbs that end in all of the possible verb endings: う つ る ー ぬ ぶ む ー く ぐ ー す. Each of these ending groups has its own way of being morphed, though although they&rsquo;re &rsquo;five level&rsquo; verbs, two of the groups use the same method so we only need to learn 4 methods. Confusingly this means that godan verbs can end in いる or える, most of these will still be *ichidan* verbs, and fortunately even if a verb is morphed incorrectly, you will probably still be understood.

-   う つ る -> って
-   ぬ ぶ む -> んで
-   く/ぐ -> いて/いで (Note: this is the combined group)
-   す -> して

There are only two irregular verbs, くる and する. いく, is partly irregular, but not completely.

-   くる -> きて
-   する -> して
-   いく -> いって (<del>いいて</del>)

These are the only exceptions

# Lesson 6: Japanese &ldquo;adjectives&rdquo;


<a id="orgc80577e"></a>

## い-adjectives, verb adjectives, and な-adjectives

Japanese adjectives are not the same as English adjectives. As we have learned Japanese sentences come in three kinds, depending on the type of engine they have. As a reminder they are:

-   う - verb - A **does** B
-   だ - noun - A **is** B
-   い - &ldquo;adjective&rdquo; - A **is** B

The truth is that all three of these types of engines can be used like adjectives.

Let&rsquo;s start with the first one, the one we refer to as an adjective in English, the い-engine:

> ぺんがあかい - Pen is red

An important note, 「あかい」 does not mean &rsquo;red&rsquo;, it means &rsquo;is red&rsquo;. 「あか」 means red.

If we swap the order of 「ぺんが」 and 「あかい」 then we can take this い-engine, and now use it not as the primary engine, but as a secondary engine. This would not be a complete sentence however without a new engine, for example, a new (primary) い engine.

> あかいぺんがちいさい - Red pen is small

This is simple enough, let&rsquo;s take a look at verbs.

Any う (verb) engine, in any tense can be used like an adjective:

> しょうじょがうたった - Girl sang

> うたったしょうじょが - The girl who sang (Note: this sentence is not yet complete, it lacks a primary engine).

> うたったしょうじょがねている - The girl who sang is sleeping

Next, the noun engine:

> いぬがやんちゃだ - The dog is naughty

We can turn 「やんちゃ」 into an adjective too, but there is one important thing to note. Just as we have to add だ to a noun, here we must add な to the noun. な is the connective form of だ. Don&rsquo;t be fooled by &rsquo;な-adjectives&rsquo;, they&rsquo;re simply nouns!

> やんちゃないぬが - The dog who is naughty (Note: this sentence is not yet complete, it lacks a primary engine).

> やんちゃないぬがねている - The dog who is naughty is sleeping

An important note is that we cannot do this with *all* nouns, only nouns which are frequently used in an adjectival way. This group of nouns is what the are referred to as &rsquo;な-adjectives&rsquo;. We can use all nouns as adjectives, but for the rest we need to use a different technique and for that we will have to learn about the の particle.


<a id="orgd3f9791"></a>

## The の-particle

The の particle, or the *possessive particle* functions just like the English *&rsquo;s*.

> さくら\*の\*はな - Sakura&rsquo;s nose

> わたし\*の\*はな - Me&rsquo;s (my) nose

Luckily in Japanese we don&rsquo;t have to worry about his/her/my/their, we just use の.

Because this is the *possessive particle* we can use this in another slightly different way. 「あか」 has an *adjectival* form in 「あかい」, but not all colours have this form. The Japanese for pink, 「ピンクいる」 (lit: pink-colour) doesn&rsquo;t have an adjectival form in 「ピンクいろい」, nor can we use it as a secondary engine with な. So what are we to do? Well we can use the の-particle:

> ピンクいる\*の\*どれすが - The pink dress (literally: The dress belonging to the class of pink things)

> うさぎ\*の\*OSCAR - Oscar the rabbit (literally: Oscar belonging to the class of rabbit)

Just as before, there&rsquo;s no need to worry about misusing の and な, no-one listening is going to misunderstand what you&rsquo;re saying and it&rsquo;s a very typical beginner mistake to make.

Using these techniques we can make all kinds of sentences that can become very complex, especially with verbal adjectives in which we can use whole sentences in an adjectival manner.


<a id="org421717e"></a>

# Lesson 7: Negatives and adjective &ldquo;conjugations&rdquo;


<a id="orgb91503c"></a>

## Negative nouns

The fundamental basis of negatives is the adjective 「ない」. This adjective means &rsquo;non-exist&rsquo;. The word for exist (for any inanimate thing) is ある. If we want to say that something exists:

> ぺんがある

But if we want to say that something doesn&rsquo;t exist we say:

> ぺんがない

Now, why do we use a verb for being, and an adjective for non-being? This is something that happens all throughout Japanese, when we do something we use a verb, but when we don&rsquo;t do something we attach ない and are therefore using an adjective as the engine of the sentence. This has a very logical reason, when we **do** something, an action is taking place, and so we use a verb, but when we **don&rsquo;t do** it we are describing a state of non-action, so that&rsquo;s an adjective.

Above we have said &rsquo;There is no pen&rsquo;, how do we say &rsquo;This is not a pen&rsquo;?

> これはぺんがある - As for this, it&rsquo;s a pen

> これはぺんではない - As for this, as for being a pen, it&rsquo;s not. (Note: で is the て-form of だ)


<a id="org545a67d"></a>

## Negative verbs and the Japanese stem system

Now let&rsquo;s look at negative verbs. To make a verb negative we must attach 「ない」 to the あ-stem of the verb. How do we do this?

Note: these stems apply to Godan verbs. For Ichidan verbs we simply drop the る and add 「ない」. Remember, all ichidan verbs end in る but not all る ending verbs are ichidan verbs.

> たべる ー> たべない

Here is the kana-grid, presented on its side. Every verb ends in one of the う-row kana. (う-row kana that aren&rsquo;t used as verb endings have been removed).

As we can see there are four other ways in which the verb could end. These are the verb stems. For now we&rsquo;re only looking at the あ-stem as this is the one we need for the negative.

To from the あ-stem we simply shift the final kana from the う-row to the あ-row. There is one only exception and this is the only exception in the entire stem system. This exception is that う itself does not become あ but わ. This is because, take for example a verb like 「かう」, 「かあ」 would not be as easy to say as 「かわ」. Every other う-row kana is simply changed to its あ-row equivalent.

So to form the negative form of a verb convert it to the あ-stem and add ない.

> かう ー> かわない

> はなす ー> はなさない


<a id="org4049dbc"></a>

## Negative adjectives and adjective &ldquo;conjugations&rdquo;

The adjective stem is simple, just drop the い and add く. This is how we make the て form, 「あかい」 ー> 「あかくて」, and it&rsquo;s also the way we make the negative, 「あかい」 ー> 「あかくない」.

If we want to put an adjective into the past tense we drop the い and add かった.

> こわい ー> こわかった - Was scary

Because 「ない」 is also an adjective, the past tense of it is just 「なかった」.

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">

<col  class="org-left" />

<td class="org-left">さくらがはし*ら*なかった</td>
<td class="org-left">Negative</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Now as we know 「さくらがはしる」 is not very natural Japanese, instead we would say 「さくらがはしっている」. For this, all we need to do is put the 「いる」 into the past tense:

> さくらがはしっている -> さくらがはしっていた - Sakura was running


<a id="org0ad821d"></a>

## The only exceptions

There are only two real exceptions to what has been covered in this lesson. They are the helper verb 「ます」 which makes words formal by adding it to the い-stem of a verb. When we put 「ます」 into the negative it does not become 「まさない」 as we would expect, but becomes 「ません」, because it is formal it is a bit old-fashioned and uses the old Japanese negative 「せん」 instead of 「ない」.

The only other exception is いい (is good), which has an older form, which is still widely used in よい. When we morph いい it becomes よい again:

> いい ー> よくない - Not-good

> いい ー> よかった - Was-good

-   Note: 「よかった」 is a common phrase: 「∅がよかった」 - *It was good (That went well, it turned out great etc.)*


<a id="org2110565"></a>

# Lesson 8: Location, purpose and transformation (に and へ particles).

We already know that in a logical sentence the に-particle marks the ultimate target of an action. If we are going somewhere, or sending something somewhere, or putting something somewhere, we use に.

> ∅がみせ\*に\*いく - (I) will go to the shop

We can also mark a more subtle kind of target:

> ∅がみせ\*に\*たまごをかい\*に\*いく - (I) will go to the shop to buy eggs

-   Note: かい is the い stem of かう, to buy.

If we recall, the logical particles (が, に, を) can only mark nouns. The い stem of a verb is the equivalent noun form of it. Just as in English &rsquo;I like swimming&rsquo;, *swimming* is a noun, &rsquo;I go to the shop for the purpose of buying eggs&rsquo;, this *buying* is also a noun.

に gives us the target of an action in the literal sense, and also the target in a volitional sense, i.e. the aim of our action.

As well as identifying a place we will go to, に can also specify a place we are currently at:

> ∅がみせ\*に\*いる - (I am) at the shop

This に is still marking a target, just not a future target. In order for something to be somewhere it must&rsquo;ve gotten there, and so に specifies the target of some past action. We can also use this for inanimate objects:

> ほんは∅がテーベルのうえ\*に\*ある - As for the book, (it) exists (is) on-at the table.

-   Note: うえ is a noun, meaning the on/top of something.

Finally, に can also mark a transformation. If *a* becomes *b*, then に also marks *b*, the thing a is becoming.

> さくらは∅がかえる\*に\*なった - Sakura became a frog

Of course this example is a bit of a joke, but there are of course various every day things that become other things. This form of expression is also used much more often in Japanese than in English.

> ことし∅が十八さいになる - This year (I) become 18 years old

> あとで∅がくもりになる - Later (it (the weather) will) become cloudy

For adjectives things work slightly differently:

> さくらがうつくしい - Sakura is beautiful

If we want to say &rsquo;Sakura became beautiful&rsquo; we can&rsquo;t use に because うつくしい isn&rsquo;t a noun, (referring back to our metaphor), it&rsquo;s not a carriage, it&rsquo;s an engine. All we need to do is turn the adjective into its stem by removing い and adding く refering back to lesson 7:

    The adjective stem is simple, just drop the い and add く. This is how we make the て form, 「あかい」 ー> 「あかくて」, and it's also the way we make the negative, 「あかい」 ー> 「あかくない」.

> さくらがうつくしくなった - Sakura became beautiful


<a id="org44aea62"></a>

## The へ car

Note: when used as a particle へ is pronounced え.

This is a very simple particle, it duplicates a single use of に. When we say *a is going to b* we can freely substitute に with へ. This is **all** is can do, it cannot even mark the case where something *is*, only where it is *going*.


<a id="orgbb052e5"></a>

# Lesson 8b: Japanese particles explained

A logical particle tells us how the sentence logically holds together. It tells us who does what to whom with what, when and where.

は is a non-logical particle, it simply identifies the topic, but doesn&rsquo;t say anything about it. Other particles like と are *alogical*, they aren&rsquo;t simply markers. In the case of と the particle &rsquo;ands&rsquo; two nouns together. It is therefore doing something in the sentence, in our train metaphor it is joining a noun-carriage to another carriage, inheriting its logical particle, but has no function of its own.

> さくら\*と\*メイリー\*が\*あるいていた - Sakura **and** Mary were walking

Logical particles **always** attach to a noun. If we see a logical particle attached to anything else then we know that that word is functionally a noun.

The noun and the particle attached to it are an inseparable pair. We must view the two together, they are a question and an answer which form a fundamental unit of the Japanese sentence.

There cannot be a sentence without が, even if sometimes you can&rsquo;t see it. が can work in A is B sentences, descriptive sentences. The other particles can **only** work in A does B sentences, that is sentences with a verb engine.

-   が - Who (or what) did it?
-   を - Whom was it done to?
-   に - Where did they go?/Where are they?
-   へ - What direction?
-   で - Where was it done? With what was it done?

> ∅がこうえん\*に\*いる - I am in the park

> ∅がこうえん\*で\*あそんでいる - I am playing in the park

Remember, 「あそんで」 is the て form of 「あそぶ」 and is a secondary engine, modifying 「いる」. *I am* -> *I am playing*.

> ∅がこうえん\*に\*いく - I go to the park

> ∅がバス\*で\*こうえんいいく - I go to the park by bus

If we say &rsquo;I went by bus&rsquo; or &rsquo;I ate with chopsticks&rsquo; we use で for the thing we did it with, the means by which we performed the action.


<a id="orgb841483"></a>

# Lesson 9: &rsquo;Ego-centrism&rsquo; and expressing desire


<a id="org8a220a0"></a>

## Ego-centrism

English is an *ego-centric* language. Japanese is a more *animist* language. What this means is that English always wants a person, preferably *I*, but if not I then someone else, or perhaps it will settle for an animal, but always wanting an animate being to be acting. Japanese is not this way:

> わたしはコーヒがすきだ

A textbook would translate this as &rsquo;I like coffee&rsquo;. &rsquo;I like coffee&rsquo; very well might be the English equivalent for this simple phrase, but it is not what this sentence means, and it is not what this structure of sentence means.

The が is marking the coffee. The coffee is the actor in this sentence, not I. It&rsquo;s not &rsquo;I like coffee&rsquo;, I am not *liking* it. But &rsquo;As for me, coffee is likeable/pleasing&rsquo;.

The English &rsquo;I like coffee&rsquo; is an *A does B* sentence. The Japanese is an *A is B* sentence.

すき is a **noun**. An adjectival noun, but still a noun. It is not a verb like in English.

If this sentence were 1-1 with the common English meaning given, then every single part of it would be miss-described by the particles.

-   は does not mark an actor
-   が does not mark an object
-   だ does not mark a verb

> わたしはほんがわかる


<a id="org671a9f6"></a>

## Expressing desire

> わたしは(optional)こねこがほしい - As for me, a kitten is wanted

「ほしい」 is often translated in English as &rsquo;want&rsquo;, but again, it is not a verb, it is an adjective. Again, *I* is not the actor of the sentence, it is the cat, and it is the cat that is wanted, not &rsquo;I want a cat&rsquo;.

In Japanese the way that wanting to **do** something is expressed is different to the way that wanting to **have** something is expressed.

The way this is done is with the い-stem again. To express that we want to do something, we must add the *helper adjective* 「たい」 to the い-stem of the verb. 「たい」 doesn&rsquo;t mean &rsquo;want&rsquo; in the English sense, it can&rsquo;t, again, because **want** is a verb, and 「たい」 is an **adjective**.

> (わたしは)クレープガたべたい

The common English translation for this is &rsquo;I want to eat crepes&rsquo;, but as we see the pattern is just the same as in the other cases, the desire-ability of the crepes is not a verb, it is an adjective.

There is no truly good translation of this into English. We shouldn&rsquo;t be thinking in terms of &rsquo;awkward English&rsquo; or &rsquo;natural English&rsquo; when it comes to constructing and understanding these sentences. We should be thinking in terms of Japanese. The &rsquo;awkward&rsquo; translations of the Japanese are only there to give a **grasp** of the structure of Japanese.

Now, what if we took this sentence, 「わたしはクレープガたべたい and removed the optional parts so that we just had 「たべたい? In this case, the meaning of the sentence would be what the common English translation is. ∅ defaults to I, and so the translation is &rsquo;I eat-wanting am&rsquo; -> &rsquo;I am wanting to eat&rsquo; -> &rsquo;I want to eat&rsquo;. Because there is no eat-inducing subject here, the want to eat is attributed directly to I.

So what is 「たい」? Is it an adjective describing the *condition of something* making you want to do something, or is it an adjective describing *my desire*? Well, it can be either. This is very common throughout Japanese. 「こわい」 can mean scared or scary:

> おばけがこわい - Ghosts are scary

> ∅がこわい - I am scared

This isn&rsquo;t confusing because が tells us what to do.


<a id="orga16e4b7"></a>

## A final note to help keep things clear

We cannot use these adjectives of desire (or any emotion) about anyone other than ourselves. If we say 「たべたい」 and there is no context to give the subject, then we must be talking about ourselves, and never the person we are speaking to or anyone else. Japanese simply doesn&rsquo;t allow us to use 「たい」 or 「こわい」 or 「ほしい」 or anything else about anyone other than ourselves.

If we wanted to say that someone else wants something then, because Japanese is such a logical language it doesn&rsquo;t allow us to say something that we cannot know for sure. One thing that we cannot know for sure is someone&rsquo;s inner feelings. We might think that Sakura wants to eat cake, but we can&rsquo;t know for sure. So if I want to talk about her desire to eat cake, we can&rsquo;t just use 「たい」. We need to add to 「たい」 (or 「こわい」, or 「ほしい」 or anything else) the helper verb がる.

To do this we take the い off of the adjective and add the helper verb 「がる」.

-   たがる
-   こわかる
-   ほしがる

「がる」 means &rsquo;to show signs of&rsquo;, &rsquo;to look as if it&rsquo;s the case&rsquo;.

> さくらがケーキをほしがる - Sakura is showing signs of wanting cake

Even if Sakura has actually told me she wants cake, we must still use 「がる」. All I know is what she&rsquo;s said, I still don&rsquo;t know her feelings absolutely.

Why do we use a verb for other people and an adjective for ourselves? I can&rsquo;t describe someone-else&rsquo;s feelings because I don&rsquo;t know about them, I can only describe their actions, and their actions are a verb.

# Lesson 10: Japanese &ldquo;conjugation&rdquo; and potential form

What textbooks typically refer to as &ldquo;conjugations&rdquo; are really just *helper-verbs* attached to the four verb stems.

We have already looked at the helper-adjectives 「ない」 and 「たい」, as well as the helper-verb 「がる」. Now for the potential helper-verb which attaches to the え-stem of a verb.

The potential helper verb has two forms, for godan verbs 「る」, and for ichidan verbs 「られる」.

There are only two exceptions, 「くる」 and 「する」.

> くる -> こられる

> する ー> できる

There is only one difficult spot with the potential form, and it is similar to the issue from the previous lesson.

> わたしは(optional)ほんがよめる - As for me, the book is readable

A common translation of this would be &rsquo;I can read the book&rsquo;, however again the が is on the book, not on I. If we wanted to say &rsquo;I can read the book&rsquo;, the book would need to be marked by を as it is the target of our reading, and &rsquo;I&rsquo; would have to be marked by が as I is the actor.

> わたしがほんをよめる - I can read the book

This is perfectly fine, but it&rsquo;s not what is usually done. Remember, Japanese is not *ego-centric*.

As we&rsquo;re using a helper-verb, the past, non-past, negative-past and negative-non-past conjugation rules are the same as regular verbs, for 「あるける」 (can walk):

-   あるける - non-past
-   あるけた - past
-   あるけない - negative-non-past
-   あるけなっかた - negative-past

# Lesson 11: Compound sentences, くれる, あげる, and more て form uses

> ある 日 アリスは 川の そばに いた。

そば is a noun meaning &rsquo;beside&rsquo;, so 川のそば means beside the river.

ある means &rsquo;a certain&rsquo;, so ある日 means &rsquo;on a certain day&rsquo;. Notice that here we&rsquo;re using a verb as an adjective, as we have described in previous lessons. 本がある (a book exists) -> ある本が (an existing/a certain book). Note also that this is the same as how we use might use Today, Yesterday, Tomorrow etc. but not how we might use &rsquo;On Saturday&rsquo;.

> On a certain day, alice was beside a river.

> おねえちゃんは つまらない 本を よんで いて あそんで くれなかった。

よむ (read) -> よんでいる (reading) -> よんでい\*て\* - We have put the いる into the て form, why have we done this?

> おねえちゃんは つまらない 本を よんで いる - Big sister is reading an uninteresting book.

This by itself is a complete clause (sentence), by turning the engine of the sentence (いる) into the て form we&rsquo;re saying that something else is going to follow this clause, i.e. &rsquo;and&rsquo;.

> おねえちゃんは つまらない 本を よんで いて - Big sister is reading an uninteresting book and&#x2026;

> あそんで くれなかった

あそぶ is to play. This has also been put into the て form. Here we have another use of the て form, let&rsquo;s examine. くれる means to &rsquo;give downwards&rsquo; i.e. as Japanese is so polite we place ourselves below others, so someone else is giving us something. あげる to contrast is to &rsquo;give upwards&rsquo; i.e. to give to someone else. What is being given? In this case the thing being given is what is attached to it via the て form, i.e. &rsquo;playing&rsquo;. Specifically, she is not giving the act of playing to Alice. In Japanese we frequently use &rsquo;give&rsquo; for actions, for doing something for our benefit as well as for literally &rsquo;giving&rsquo; nouns. If someone does something for our benefit, we turn that action to the て form, and attach it to くれる. If we do something for someone else&rsquo;s benefit, we turn that action to the て form, and attach it to あげる.

> Big sister is reading an uninteresting book and didn&rsquo;t play with Alice (didn&rsquo;t play for Alice&rsquo;s benefit).

Note again our two clauses:

> おねえちゃんは つまらない 本を よんで いて

> あそんで くれなかった

For the first clause we do not know what in what tense the action is taking place. In English we would place the tense marker on both clauses, in Japanese we only do this at the end. よんで いて could mean &rsquo;is reading&rsquo; and it could mean &rsquo;was reading&rsquo;. Because くれなかった is in the past tense, then the entire sentence is in the past tense.

# Lesson 12: と quotation particle and compound verbs and compound nouns

> 「おもしろい ことが ない」 と アリスは 言った

-   もの - thing concrete
-   こと - thing abstract

> 「おもしろい ことが ない」- No interesting (abstract) thing exists (Nothing interesting is going on here)

> アリスは 言った - Alice said

The interesting thing to note is the particle between these two, the と particle. There are two と particles, one means &rsquo;and&rsquo;, and one marks a quotation. When we quote someone as saying something or as thinking something we use this と particle. We also use these square brackets which are the equivalent of English quotation marks, but in speech we cannot see these, so we also use と (and clearly use と in writing regardless also).

> 「おもしろい ことが ない」 と アリスは 言った - Nothing interesting is happening said Alice

> そのとき、白い ウサギが とおり すぎた。

-   そのとき - That time, in this sentence it is used to mean &rsquo;just at that moment&rsquo; (just as Alice said that)
-   とおる - pass through
-   すぎる - exceed, go beyond

とおりすぎる is doing something very interesting. It is attaching the い stem of one verb, to another verb to give it extra meaning. We will see this a lot throughout Japanese. Connecting とおる and すぎる, &rsquo;pass through&rsquo; and &rsquo;go beyond&rsquo; means &rsquo;passing by&rsquo;.

> そのとき、白い ウサギが とおり すぎた。 - At that moment a white rabbit passed by

> ふつうの ウサギでは なくて、 チョッキを きて いる ウサギ だった。

> ふつうの ウサギでは なくて - Not an ordinary rabbit

では here is the て-form of the copula だ, meaning &rsquo;as for being (an ordinary rabbit)&rsquo;

> チョッキを きて いる ウサギ だった。- It was a rabbit that was wearing a vest (it was a wearing a vest rabbit)

> ウサギは かいちゅうどけいを 見て 「おそい!おおい!」と言って、はしり だした。

-   かいちゅうどけい is the combination of かいちゅう (inside pocket) and どけい (watch) meaning pocket-watch. An interesting note here is that とけい becomes どけい

> 「おそい!おおい!」と

What と does structurally, is it takes whatever it marks which could be a whole paragraph, or just two short words like this, or anything with all sorts of grammar going on, it takes whatever it marks as a quotation and turns it into a single noun. Going forward we will find that this is used not only to mark things people say and people think, but to mark all sorts of things. This と structure can therefore make a quotation act as a modifier to whatever follows, in this cast it is modifying 言う (to say), or to think or feel, but could be many things.

Note: As there must be a ∅ somewhere the rabbit is either saying &rsquo;it&rsquo;s late&rsquo; or &rsquo;I&rsquo;m late&rsquo;.
Note also, we don&rsquo;t need to use ウサギは again as it is already marked in the first half of the sentence.

> はしり だした - Run + Take out = Broke into a run (started to run). In this sense だした means modifies the verb to mean the action &rsquo;erupted&rsquo;.

> ウサギは かいちゅうどけいを 見て 「おそい!おおい!」と言って、はしり だした。 - The rabbit looked at his watch and said &rsquo;I&rsquo;m late! I&rsquo;m late&rsquo; and broke out into a run.

Note: all the uses of て-form to mark &rsquo;and&rsquo;.

> 「ちょっと まって ください」 と アリスは よんだ。

> 「ちょっと まって ください」 と - Please wait a little

> 「ちょっと まって ください」 と アリスは よんだ。

よんだ is the て-form of よぶ (to shout/call).
Note: Both よむ and よぶ conjugate to よんだ in the て form, fortunately it&rsquo;s not likely that we&rsquo;ll get these two verbs mixed up.

> 「ちょっと まって ください」 と アリスは よんだ。 - Please wait a minute called Alice

> でも ウサギは ピョンピョンと はしり つづけた。

-   でも - but
-   はしる + つづける = Continued running (running continued).
-   ピョンピョン - The sound of a small thing jumping along

Once again we&rsquo;re using the quotation particle と to describe the way in which it run, it ran in the way it sounds, it ran like a small thing jumping along (note there are no quotation marks around this).

# Lesson 13: Passive &ldquo;conjugation&rdquo; - Not passive and not a conjugation

The real name for the &rsquo;passive conjugation&rsquo; is the *Receptive helper verb*.

The receptive helper verb is れる for godan verbs and られる for ichidan verbs, and attaches to the あ-stem of another verb.

Remember! う becomes わ, not あ.

The receptive helper verb means *receive* or *get*, we&rsquo;re receiving/getting the action that the helper verb is attached to

> さくらがしか\*ら\*れた - Sakura scolded-got - Sakura got scolded/Sakura received a scolding

Note, the receptive helper verb and the modified verb have different actors. The sentence is not Sakura scolds, someone else (we don&rsquo;t know who) is scolding Sakura, but Sakura is the one in the act of receiving the scolding. This is not the same with all helper verbs.

The receiver is not always a person:

> 水がの\*ま\*れた - Water got drunk

Even if we add a doer of the drinking, the water is still the actor of the sentence.

> 水がいぬにの\*ま\*れた - Water got drunk by (a) dog

いぬに is modifying のむ.

Why is the dog being marked by に? Let&rsquo;s look at a larger sentence:

> さくらは だれかに かばんが ぬす\*ま\* れた - As for Sakura, someone-by bag stolen-got - As for Sakura, (her) bag got stolen by someone

Who is the actor? It&rsquo;s not Sakura, she&rsquo;s marked by は. It&rsquo;s not the &rsquo;someone&rsquo; as they&rsquo;re marked by に. The bag is the actor of the sentence, the bag *did* &rsquo;got&rsquo;.

What is に doing here? に marks the ultimate target of an action. So what is the target of getting stolen? To whom is the stolen item going? It is the &rsquo;someone&rsquo; who stole it.

Note: Cure Dolly uses a *push-pull* analogy here, which I think is unnecessary.


<a id="orgdd619cf"></a>

## The nuisance receptive

> さくらが だれかに かばんを ぬす\*ま\* れた

Here the core of the sentence is now &rsquo;Sakura got&rsquo;. What did she get? She got the unfortunate (nuisance) action of だれかに かばんを ぬすむ, someone stealing (her) bag. *Sakura got her bag stolen by someone* **not** *Sakura&rsquo;s bag got stolen by someone*.


<a id="org3750317"></a>

# Lesson 14: Adverbs and も-particle

> アリスは とび 上がって、 ウサギの 後を 追った。

-   とび上がって = とぶ (jump/fly) + 上がる (rise up) = Jump up
-   後を追った = 後 (after) + 追う (follow) = Follow after/follow behind

Note how we are following ウサギの後 - *the rabbit&rsquo;s after/behind*. We are following the back of the rabbit.

> アリスは とび 上がって、 ウサギの 後を 追った。 - Alice jumped up and followed after the rabbit

&#x2014;

> しゃべる ウサギを 見た ことが ない。

Here しゃべる is being used as an adjective just as any verb can be. しゃべるウサギ - Talkative/talking rabbit.

見た is the passed tense of 見る to see. It is modifying こと, an abstract thing, meaning &rsquo;The fact of having seen&rsquo;. 見たことがない means &rsquo;The fact of having seen doesn&rsquo;t exist&rsquo;.

The talking rabbit is the object of the engine of the sentence, &rsquo;The fact of having seen&rsquo;. So: &rsquo;The fact of having seen a talking rabbit doesn&rsquo;t exist&rsquo; -> (Alice) had never seen a talking rabbit. This is another example of the un-egocentric nature of Japanese; Alice is not the actor of this sentence, it is the &rsquo;thing&rsquo; that does not exist.

&#x2014;

> ウサギは 早く 走って、 急に ウサギの 穴に とび 込んだ。

> ウサギは 早く 走って、

-   早い - fast/early
-   走る - run

早い is an adjective. If we want to say the rabbit is fast we simply say ウサギが早い. But if we want to say that the rabbit&rsquo;s **movement** is fast we must use an adverb. In Japanese we can turn any adjective into an adverb by simply removing the い and replacing it with く. 早い -> 早く.

Note again how our verb 走る has been converted to the て form signifying an &rsquo;and&rsquo;.

> 急に ウサギの 穴に とび 込んだ。

-   ウサギの 穴に - Here we aren&rsquo;t saying &rsquo;The rabbit&rsquo;s hole&rsquo; but &rsquo;a hole of the variety rabbit&rsquo;.
-   とび 込む = とぶ (jump) + こむ (Squeeze (?) into) = Jump into

急に is another way of forming an adverb. 急 is a noun meaning &rsquo;suddenly&rsquo;. We can form an adjective from a noun by adding に.

> ウサギは 早く 走って、 急に ウサギの 穴に とび 込んだ。- The rabbit ran quickly and jumped into a rabbit hole.


<a id="orgc7c4106"></a>

## The も flag

> アリス\*も\* ウサギの 穴に とび こんだ。 - Alice also jumped into the rabbit hole.

も is another non-logical topic-marking particle. も marks the topic of the sentence in the same way that は does. The difference is that while は can mark the topic of the sentence and **can** also change the topic of the sentence, も declares the topic of the sentence but can **only** change the topic of the sentence. We cannot use も unless we are changing the topic of the sentence. Up until this point the topic of our conversation has been the rabbit, now we are switching to talk about Alice.

When we change topic with も we&rsquo;re saying that the comment about the previous topic (the rabbit and that it jumped) is the same as our new topic (Alice). When we change the topic with は we are doing the opposite, we are drawing a distinction between the two.

&#x2014;

> 穴の 中は たて穴 だった。 アリスは すぐ下に 落さた。- The inside of the hole was a vertical hole. Alice fell straight (directly) down the hole.

> でも、 おどろいたことに ゆっくり ゆっくり 落さた。 - But, the surprising thing was that she slowly slowly fell/ But, surprisingly she fell slowly.

-   おどろいたこと doesn&rsquo;t mean &rsquo;A surprised thing&rsquo;, it means &rsquo;the surprising thing&rsquo; (surprisingly). The に attached is again to turn it into an adverb. So: &rsquo;She fell surprisingly&rsquo;. Of course, it isn&rsquo;t surprising that she fell, but it is surprising that she fell ゆっくり ゆっくり (slowly slowly).
-   ゆっくり is slightly unusual in that it is fundamentally a noun, but we can use it as an adjective without adding に to it. We will see ゆっくり very often.

# Lesson 15: Transitivity

*Transitive* and *intransitive* aren&rsquo;t as big of a misnomer as some of the things we&rsquo;ve seen so far, but a better pair of terms would be *Self-move* and *Other-move*.

In japanese, a move-word 動詞 (どうし) is a word that denotes an action of a movement. So a self-move verb is a verb that moves itself. If I &rsquo;stand-up&rsquo; that&rsquo;s a self-move action. But throwing a ball is an &rsquo;other-move&rsquo; action, one is not throwing themselves, they are throwing a ball. It&rsquo;s as simple as that.

Japanese has a lot of pairs of words, these could be called forms, or just closely related words, that give the self-move and other-move variations of the verb. For example:

-   出る (でる) - leave, exit, come out - Self-move
-   出す (だす) - take out, bring out - Other-move

Most of the time we can tell which is a self-move word and which is an other-move word by following a few simple rules.

The first thing to know is that there is a root word for self-move and a root word for other-mode:

-   ある - Be - Self-move
-   する - Do - Other-move

Knowing this there are three laws of move-word pairs.

1.  す and せる (え-stem) ending verbs are other-move
2.  あ-stem + る (aru) ending verbs are self-move
3.  え-stem + る (eru) flip self/other-move either way

Honorary members of the す family:

-   む -> める is always other-move
-   ぶ -> べる is always other-move
-   つ -> てる is always other-move

The only wildcards left are:

-   く/ぐ -> ける/げる
-   う ー> える
-   Some る-ending verbs not covered by the first two laws

Is there anything we can do to simplify this: える version have the opposite of the standard word.

# Lesson 17: Form Japanese: です/ます + volitional

ます is a (helper) verb that attaches to the い stem of another verb. It doesn&rsquo;t change the meaning of the verb in anyway, it just makes it formal. ます is highly irregular:

-   The past tense is normal, it ends just like any す verb - ました
-   The negative past tense is not ませない, it is ません - This is the only verb that does this in modern Japanese
-   The negative past is ませんでした

です is the formal version of だ and works exactly the same aside from one quirk, unlike with だ which we do not attach to adjectives, we do attach です in formal speech. It doesn&rsquo;t mean or do anything, but it&rsquo;s done all the same.

A useful note, we can use ません and ないです interchangeably:

-   さくらが話しません
-   さくらが話しないです

**The volitional form**

The volitional form is one of the few uses of the お-stem. The godan volitional helper is just う, attached to the お stem it simply lengths the お sound. The ichidan form is to as usual remove the る, and add よう.

The volitional form of ます and です are ましょう and でしょう.

Volition means will, the volitional form expresses or invokes the will of the speaker. The most usual use of it is setting the will of a group of people in a particular direction. いきましょう = Let&rsquo;s go.

There are many uses of the volitional form in combination with various particles but they will be covered in due time. One of note for now is the volitional copula だろう / でしょう which when added to any ordinary sentence adds the extra meaning of *probably*, i.e. it adds doubt/conjecture.

-   赤いでしょう - Probably red
-   さくらがくるでしょう - Sakura&rsquo;s probably coming.

# Lesson 18: Trying to do something; って = は? として、 と言う/という、 と する、 おう と する、 っていう


<a id="orge173d2d"></a>

## Try - と する

> 山にのぼろうとする - Try to climb the mountain

-   のぼる = Climb
-   Note: に is normal here because we are climbing to the *target* of the summit.

Why does this mean &rsquo;try&rsquo;? A precise translation may be derived from のぼろう - have the will to climb, and する to do. I have the will to climb the mountain, and I will do it, (but I may not have the ability). Hence, *try*.


<a id="org5c2bd58"></a>

## How we regard something - と する

See again how we&rsquo;re using the と quotation particle once again. と is encapsulating, not the words or thoughts of someone, but the meaning of 「山にのぼろう」 and putting that meaning into action (する).

Another example:

> ホッとする

-   ホッ is the sound effect for a sigh of relief

We aren&rsquo;t saying here that someone breathed a sigh of relief. What we&rsquo;re saying is that they *enacted what was expressed by the sound effect* i.e. They were relieved. In 山にのぼろうとする we&rsquo;re enacting the feeling of setting out to climb the mountain.

> ∅が さくらを **日本人と** する - We Sakura &ldquo;Japanese person&rdquo; enact - We assume/take Sakura to be Japanese

We are thinking/acting according what is expressed by the quote.

Compare this with:

> ∅が さくらを **日本人に** する - We turned Sakura into a Japanese person

> かばんを **まくらと** する - Use bag as a pillow

Not literally: turn bag into a pillow.


<a id="orgcccf1e4"></a>

## See something in the light of being something - と して

The closest equivalent to this in English is &rsquo;as&rsquo;. i.e. &rsquo;My opinion *as* a private person&rsquo;.

> 会長\*として\* - As President&#x2026;

We can also use it as &rsquo;for&rsquo;:

> アメリカジン\*として\*小さい - She&rsquo;s small for an American. (As an American, she&rsquo;s small).


<a id="org1e03f9a"></a>

## As a quotation -  と言う/という

The most basic thing that can follow と is 言う in which case it can be used as a literal quotation of something that&rsquo;s been said (as we&rsquo;ve already seen) but can also be used as a way of saying how something is said or what it&rsquo;s called:

> ふしぎの国のアリスという本 - The book called 「ふしぎの国のアリス」

-   Note: という is usually written in Kana when it precedes something

という can be reduced down as far as just って. という -> っていう -> って:

> ふしぎの国のアリスっていう本 - The book called 「ふしぎの国のアリス」

> ふしぎの国のアリスって本 - The book called 「ふしぎの国のアリス」


<a id="orgbd76d2b"></a>

## って as は

Remember the は particle is the topic marking particle:

> さくらは ∅が 日本人だ - As for Sakura, (she) is a Japanese person

> さくらって ∅が 日本人だ - Speaking of Sakura, (she) is a Japanese person

This is a very casual use, we can&rsquo;t use という in place of は but we can use って. The point is that this is still very logical.

# Lesson 19: Causative + &rsquo;causative passive&rsquo;

The *causative helper verb* indicates that we are causing someone to do the verb to which is is attached.

The *receptive helper verb* indicates receiving the action to which it is attached.

The causative and the receptive both attach to the あ-stem of a verb.

-   Causative: せる/させる
-   Receptive: れる/られる

It is important to understand that the verb and the helper verb always have different subjects

> 水が 犬に 飲む れた - The water got drunk by the dog (receptive)

-   Core action: verb れる (get/receive), actor 水 (water)
    -   Secondary action: verb 飲む (drink), actor 犬 (dog)
        -   Implicit sub-clause: 犬が 飲んだ

> さくらが だれかに かばんを ぬすま れた - Sakura got her bag stolen by someone (receptive)

-   Core action: verb れる (get/receive), actor さくら
    -   Secondary action: object かばん (bag), actor だれか (someone)
        -   Implicit sub-clause: だれかが かばんを ぬすんだ

> ∅が 犬を 食べ させた - I caused the dog to eat (causative)

-   Core action: verb させる (cause), actor ∅ (I)
    -   Secondary action: verb たべる (eat), actor 犬 (dog)
        -   Implicit sub-clause: 犬が 食べた

せる/させる can mean to *compel/make/force*, or it can mean to *allow*. But it can also mean neither of those. The best way to translate it is with the rather non-native sounding &rsquo;cause&rsquo;. &rsquo;I caused the dog to eat&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean &rsquo;I forced the dog to eat&rsquo;, it just means that I did something that had the result of the dog eating, whether that be intentional, accidental, or forceful.

Sometimes the person or thing we are causing to do something can be marked by を and sometimes it can be marked by に. Remember the particles are always consistent. If we are forcing someone to do something, then we&rsquo;re treating them like an object (を), if we&rsquo;re treating them as a target, then this is more mutual and goes with *allowing* over *compelling* and so に.

That said the use of を and に is not the main indicator of if we mean allowing or compelling. There is no precise English analogy with the causative helper verb, so trying to determine if it means exactly cause or exactly allow is misguided, remember, it can mean neither. It&rsquo;s sort of a sliding scale between the two, more subtle. Beyond that, when the action that is being compelled has itself an を marked object we can see that in the sub(ordinate) sentence the meat is the object of the dog&rsquo;s action, and the dog is the thing that is being caused to do the action:

> ∅が犬に にくを 食べ させた - I caused the dog to eat meat

-   Core action: verb させる (cause), actor ∅ (I)
    -   Secondary action: verb たべる (eat), actor 犬 (dog)
        -   Implicit sub-clause: 犬が にくを 食べた

に expresses relation to core clause. を expresses relation to sub clause.

In these types of sentences Japanese does not allow us to use the を particle twice. If we could use を twice then in some sentences we might end up with some doubt as to which を marks the object associated with 食べる and which を marks the object associated with せる/させる.


<a id="org828bdb2"></a>

## Causative receptive (causative passive)

Causative-receptive (what most call the causative passive) means to get made to do. Remembering that helper verbs are ichidan verbs, to add the receptive helper verb to the causative helper verb we simple remove the る and add られる:

-   せる/させる - る + られる = せられる/させられる

We now have three verbs in a sentence:

> わたしは ∅が ブロコリを 食べ(1) させ<sup>2</sup> られた<sup>2</sup> - I got<sup>3</sup> compelled<sup>2</sup> to eat<sup>1</sup> broccoli

-   Core action: verb られる (get), actor ∅ (I)
    -   Secondary action: verb させる (compel), actor unspecified
        -   Tertiary action: verb 食べる (eat), actor ∅ (I)

Note: The first and third actor are always the same. The second actor always different.

# Lesson 20: Sore/Sono/Sonna/Sou etc. Directional Words

こ そ あ ど words initially simply mark physical locations, but then expands out to more subtle and metaphorical uses. This is common because all languages use physical metaphors to express abstract concepts.

The most basic meaning:

-   Often ここ means the speaker&rsquo;s place and そこ means the listener&rsquo;s place
-   Often あそこ means away from both the speaker and the listener


<a id="orgb8a2c61"></a>

## れ-group (nouns)

The れ group act as nouns.

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">

<td class="org-left">That</td>
<td class="org-left">That (other there)</td>
<td class="org-left">Which thing?</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

These can get confused with the の-group as in English we use the same word for both of these types of words.


<a id="orgf8e4f5f"></a>

## の-group (adjectivals)

The の group act as adjectives.

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="org-left" />

<col  class="org-left" />

<td class="org-left">described as near you</td>
<td class="org-left">described as over there</td>
<td class="org-left">how-described?</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

れ means a being, it refers to a thing. の is used to make adjectivals and descriptors:

> これは (∅が) ペンだ - As for here-thing (it) pen-is - The thing here is a pen

> この ペンは (∅が) 赤い - Here&rsquo;s pen as for (it) red-is - The pen that is here is red


<a id="orga427aea"></a>

## な-group (real adjectives)

The な-group act as real adjectives

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="org-left" />

<col  class="org-left" />

<tr>
<td class="org-left">Like this</td>
<td class="org-left">Like that</td>
<td class="org-left">Like that</td>
<td class="org-left">Like what?</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The な used for adjectival nouns descriptive of a thing&rsquo;s qualities. Distance is often conceptual, no physical. i.e. How far the thing is from what we&rsquo;re talking about or the present-circumstance.

> こんあ食べ物 = Food like this

> そんあことがひどい - A thing like that is cruel

These are essentially comparing-adjectives. Saying that something is like something either in physical space or in a conceptual way.


<a id="org75c38ec"></a>

## う/あ-group

Lengthening the final sound of こ/そ/あ/ど is talking about the way something is/happens.

> ∅がそうです - It (the fact/situation) is that way = That&rsquo;s right

> そうせる - Do like that

> こうせる - Do like this

> どうせる - Do it like how?

> どうすればいい - In what way if I act will be good?

-   すれば is the conditional form of する

> そういうこと - That way say matter (condition/thing) - Thus-described matter - That kind of thing

> どういうこと - What way said matter (condition/thing) - What is going on here?

The いう here is not referring to the fact we&rsquo;ve said anything. The いう refers to the description of the thing.


<a id="org8300ea3"></a>

# Lesson 21: Te oku/te aru

> その びんは ラベルが 貼って あって 「オレンジ•マーマレード」と 書いて あった

> その びんは ラベルが 貼って あって - A label was pasted to the bottle

貼って ある is something not yet covered. We&rsquo;ve used the て-form of a verb + いる meaning to be in the state of doing that verb. て ある also means to be in the state of that verb, however there is a difference:

> 窓が開いている - The window is open

> 窓が開けてある - The window is open

What is the difference? いる simply means is open, however ある carries another implication. Notice the use of the other-move verb in ある and the self-move verb in いる. 開けてある therefore signals that the window is open **because** someone opened it.

Notice how we&rsquo;re using いる, the verb for animate objects to describe the openness of an inanimate object. Because we have used the self-move verb the inanimate object is an honorary &rsquo;willed being&rsquo; with a state of its own. In the example with ある the state has been caused externally, and so the window maintains its inanimateness.

> その びんは ラベルが 貼って あって - The jar existed in the state of having a label stuck to it and&#x2026;

> 「オレンジ•マーマレード」と 書いて あった - (it) was in the state of having &rsquo;Orange marmalade&rsquo; written on it


<a id="org90f1858"></a>

## ておく

*Skipping ahead a little* Alice realises that the marmalade jar is in fact empty. What is she to do with it? She doesn&rsquo;t want to drop it, what will she do?

> [アリスが びんを] うまく とだなの 一つく 通りすがりに 置いて\* おいた\* - She skilfully in passing put the jar into one of the cupboards

-   \* Same word used twice, helper usually written in kana alone
-   うまく - skilfully
-   とだな - cupboard
-   通りすがり - in passing
-   置く - place/put

The second おく here (ておく) is in a sense the second half of てある:

> 窓が開けてある - Exist in the state of having been made open

> 窓を開けてあく - Open the window so that it remains in the state of openness. Establish the window as being in the state of openness

In many cases this is used to mean &rsquo;doing something in advance&rsquo; but it is not the only meaning, as we see here. What is literally means is putting the action in place.


<a id="org381d48a"></a>

# Lesson 22: Te-wa, te-mo - Topic/comment magic

> でも、びんは 空っぽ だった - But the jar was empty

&#x2014;

> アリスは 空っぽの びん\*でも\*、下へ 落としては 悪いと 思った

The で here is the て form of だ and it is attached to も, the inclusive *and* particle and the reverse subject particle of は:

> ∅が 空っぽの びんでも - It empty jar-is as-much-as

-   も = as-much-as i.e. &rsquo;even though&rsquo;

The て-form + topic-marker combination forms a complete logical clause that is subordinate to (requiring comment from) the following clause

> ∅が 空っぽの びんでも - Even though it was an empty jar&#x2026;

This is a new usage of も, there are many similar usages of this particle:

-   いちま円もかかた掛かる - He took as much as 10,000 yen
-   ケエキを食べてもいい - Is it alright if I eat this cake? lit. If I go as far as to eat the cake is that alright?

> 下へ 落としては 悪いと 思った

落としては now we have て-form + は topic marker. While も is the additive, including particle, は is the subtractive, excluding particle. So, while も means &rsquo;as much as&rsquo;, は means &rsquo;as little as&rsquo;. We tend to use でも in positive contexts, and では in negative contexts. Often this ては gets contracted into just ちゃ.

We can use ては as the connector between two clauses, and it implies that the second clause is unwanted:

> 雨が 降っ\*ては\* ： ∅が こうえんい 行けない - Rain falls and (negative comment expected) : we park-to can-go-not

This is much the same as how も is followed by a comment, here we follow は with a comment explaining why the rain falling is a bad thing.

> ∅が いもうとと けんかし\*ては\* ： ははに しかられた - I sister-with quarrelled-and (negative result) : mother-by scolded-got

ても on the other hand doesn&rsquo;t indicate a positive result or a negative result, it indicates a contrasting result:

> 雨が 降っ\*ても\* ： ∅が こうえんい 行く - Even though it&rsquo;s raining we can still go to the park

This is where でも itself, rightly translated as &rsquo;but&rsquo;, comes from; でも wraps up whatever came before it literally meaning &rsquo;as much as [that] is [so]&#x2026;&rsquo;. でも is the all purpose ても contrast marker.

> アリスは 空っぽの びんでも、下へ 落としては 悪い\*と\* 思った

と bundles the entire thing into a quotation, of Alice&rsquo;s thoughts (思て). The full sentence therefore is: &rsquo;Empty jar-is-even-though, downward drop (negative expectation) is bad, Alice thought.&rsquo; - &rsquo;Alice thought that even though the jar is empty, dropping it would be bad&rsquo;.


<a id="orgdd286fb"></a>

# Extra: も particle combinations

も is the additive particle, and can also be used to mean &rsquo;as much as&rsquo; in several expressions. In English &rsquo;as much as&rsquo; can also be said as &rsquo;even&rsquo;. The same is true in Japanese.

-   誰もない - Not even someone
-   何もない - Not even something
-   少しもない - Not even a little

What about でも? The で here is not the particle で, it is the て-form of だ. As we know だ (the copula) couples together two nouns. What is it coupling? It is couple the sentence that came before it and the ∅ pronoun (it). So 誰でも doesn&rsquo;t mean &rsquo;everyone&rsquo;, it means anyone.

-   誰でも - Anyone - 誰でもできろ - Even if it&rsquo;s anyone, they can do it - Anyone can do it
-   何でも - Anything - 何でもいい - Even if it&rsquo;s anything, it&rsquo;s good - Anything is good
-   どうでも - However (Whatever way) - どうでもいい - Whatever way is fine

> かもしれません - Perhaps

-   か - Makes a question of whatever came before
-   も - Even/As much as
-   知れ - Potential form of know
-   ない/ません - Can&rsquo;t know (don&rsquo;t have the potential to know)

> かもしれません - As to whether that is true or not I can can&rsquo;t go as far as to know


<a id="orgcb1f9a9"></a>

# Lesson 23: だって, だから, それ から

だって is usually translated as &rsquo;because&rsquo; and &rsquo;but&rsquo; and &rsquo;even&rsquo; and &rsquo;somebody said&rsquo;. The reason for these myriad definitions is that だって isn&rsquo;t really a word.

だって is simply the copula だ, and って. This is not the て-form of だ, it is the same って as the contraction of the quotation particle という.

Firstly, *somebody said*:

> **(∅が) 明日は** (∅が) 晴れだ **って(という)** - **(Someone/weather forecast/people)** as for tomorrow (it) fine will-be **says**

&#x2014;

*But:*

> 1.  さくらがきれいだね - Sakura&rsquo;s pretty isn&rsquo;t she
> 2.  だって 頭が 弱い - But she&rsquo;s not very smary (lit: head is weak)

Note: This usage usually has a childish, or somewhat argumentative tone.

Why does this mean &rsquo;but&rsquo;? What we&rsquo;re doing is taking the thing that was just said and adding だ to it. Then quoting what they just said: だって - You say that (Sakura is pretty), and the implication is that something contradictory will follow.

&#x2014;

> (&#x2026;)だから - From that (what you/I just said) - Therefore; as above.

&#x2014;

*Because:* Just as we can use だって as &rsquo;You say a thing is so, but&#x2026;&rsquo; We can also use だって as &rsquo;You say a thing is so, this is because (some explanation)&rsquo;.

What both of these phrases are saying is &rsquo;You have said something, and I don&rsquo;t dispute it, but here&rsquo;s something we can add to it that undermines the narrative that you&rsquo;re trying to put forward&rsquo;. This is the same in both cases, it&rsquo;s only the translation to English that mandates a distinction.

&#x2014;

*Even:*
When we say だって to mean even we&rsquo;re not using だ in the same was as だから or in the other sense we&rsquo;ve just spoken about, i.e. we aren&rsquo;t using it to refer back to the previous statement. We are usually attaching it to something in particular within the statement we&rsquo;re making.

> 1.  さくらができる - Sakura can do that
> 2.  わたしだって - Say (it) is me - I can do that

This has a different implication to わたしもできる which just means &rsquo;I can do that too&rsquo;, わたしだって, because it is associated with the phrases above carries the *tone* of &rsquo;*even* I can do that&rsquo;.

> わたしだってホトケーキがつくられる - Even I can make hot cakes

In this example we aren&rsquo;t saying anything contradictory to someone else but it still has the implication of *even*.

# Lesson 24: Hearsay and guesses: ~そうだ, ~そうです


<a id="org71532ac"></a>

## Likeness

そう is a *helper noun* that can mean either &rsquo;likeness&rsquo;, or &rsquo;hearsay&rsquo;.

そう is the same そう as in the こう/そう/ああ/どう (in this way/in that way/in *that* way/in what way) group we learned about in lesson 20. そう can be used with any of the three engines: う (verbs), い (adjectives) or だ (nouns). Simply remove the final kana and add そう for &rsquo;seems like&rsquo; meaning. In the case of だ the engine must be an adjectival noun (な-adjective).

Remember that each of the three engines can be moved behind other cars to turn them into adjectives.

Once そう has been attached to an engine, the engine becomes a new adjectival noun.

> 元気だ -> 元気そう - Is healthy -> Seems healthy

> 元気な学生 -> 元気そう学生 - Healthy student -> Healthy looking student

---

> おもしろい -> おもしろそうだ - Is interesting -> Seems interesting

-   Note: Logically だ must always be used with そう, but colloquially it is often left off.

Remember, in Japanese we can only say things that we actually know for ourselves, so unless we have read/tasted/experienced/whatever that thing which the other person is describing, we must say そう as we cannot **know** that is is the way that they say.

---

For verbs, in the case of ichidan we just remove る as usual, and in the case of godan we use the い-stem of the verb. The い-stem of a verb is what we might call the &rsquo;pure-stem&rsquo; of a verb. In Japanese this is called 「連用形」(れんようけい) which means &rsquo;connective-use form&rsquo;.

> 泣きそうだ - Seems about to cry

-   Note: Again; logically だ must always be used with そう, but colloquially it is often left off.


<a id="orgd153810"></a>

## Hearsay

The そう used for likeness is a *suffix*, it is joined to other words in order to form a new word. Whatever the word was to start with, once そう is attached, it becomes an adjectival noun. This is not what happens with hearsay.

When talking about hearsay we use そうだ/そうです after the entire, complete sentence. Back to the train metaphor, the entire logical sentence becomes the main car at the core of a new sentence being pulled by a だ-engine.

> さくらが日本人だ -> さくらが日本人だそうだ - Sakura is Japanese -> Sakura is Japanese I hear

So simply put そうだ at the end of any full statement.


<a id="orgd7129fb"></a>

# Lesson 25: らしい vs そうです

らしい is a *helper adjective*. Adjectives that end in しい we can consider a sub-class of adjectives that on the whole express subjectivities. That is to say, they are adjectives not describing an inherent property of something, but a (possible) human perspective on it:

-   かなしい - Sad
-   うれしい - Happy
-   むずかしい - Difficult
-   やさしい - Easy

Like そう, らしい can be attached either to an individual word or to a complete logical clause/sentence. We don&rsquo;t need to change anything about the word, just attach らしい to it.

As with そう, if we attach らしい to a single word, we are talking about our (subjective) impression of that action or state.

And again as with そう, if we attach らしい to a sentence we&rsquo;re indicating that the statement itself is subjective, i.e. a deduction/hearsay/conjecture.

There is a difference however:

> あの動物はウサギだ\*そうだ\* - I heard that animal is a rabbit

> あの動物はウサギだ\*らしい\* - It seems that animal is a rabbit

These two *can* mean the same thing, but not always. そう is specific to &rsquo;I heard&rsquo;, whereas らしい means that from the available evidence, which *could* be what somebody said, or could be something else, it *seems* to be a rabbit.

When it comes to the difference between そう and らしい with respect to a single word, the main difference is that we can&rsquo;t apply そうだ to a regular noun. We can only apply it to an adjectival noun. らしい can be applied to any noun, adjectival or otherwise.

らしい has the ability to liken one thing to another:

> あの動物はウサギだ\*らしい\* - That animal is rabbit like

らしい is not-necessarily conjecturing that something is something else, we may merely be saying that it is like that thing.

> 男らしい男 - Manly man

> さくら先生は先生らしくない - Sakura-sensei is not like (does not have the qualities of) a teacher

> それはさくらしくない - That wasn&rsquo;t like (you) Sakura


<a id="orgb5654bc"></a>

## っぽい

> こどもっぽい - Childish

っぽい works very much like らしい and is also a *helper adjective* but is much more casual than らしい.

っぽい cannot be used on the end of a completed clause, it can only be attached to a word.

らしい tends to imply that the quality is something that the thing ought to have, っぽい often tends to imply the opposite. This is not an absolute rule, just a tendency.

> こどもらしい - Childlike

> こどもっぽい - Childish

# Lesson 26: Similes - のように、 のような、 みたい

「ようだ」 forms the far end of a sliding scale of &rsquo;likeness&rsquo; expressions:

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="org-left" />

<col  class="org-left" />

<col  class="org-left" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="org-left">Objectivity</td>
<td class="org-left">&#xa0;</td>
<td class="org-left">Subjectivity</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="org-left">そうだ</td>
<td class="org-left">らしい</td>
<td class="org-left">ようだ + みたい</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td class="org-left">Hearsay/conjecture</td>
<td class="org-left">Observation/quality comparison</td>
<td class="org-left">Pure simile</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Each of these expressions can be placed at the end of a complete logical sentence to express that the sentence is either something we&rsquo;ve heard or some conjecture from the information available.

When we attach them to individual words then we have this sliding scale of meaning.

-   そうだ - Conjecture of what the quality of something is: 「おいしいそうだ」 - It looks delicious
-   らしい - Has a much greater degree of subjectivity. 「らしい」 overlaps with 「そうだ」 in many respects but it can also do things that 「そうだ」 cannot. 「らしい」 can compare things to other things that we know they aren&rsquo;t: 「ウサギらしい」 - Rabbit-like (even though we know it isn&rsquo;t a rabbit). 「こどもらしい」 - Childlike (whether they are a child or not)
-   ようだ - 「ようだ」 can be much more subjective still, going as far as a *metaphor* or *simile*

> 山のようだ - Like a mountain

> 風のように走る - Runs like the wind

Often when 「ようだ」 is being used as a metaphor/simile it is used alongside 「まるで」:

> 日の丸 - Circle of the sun

-   まるで (usually does not use まる kanji) - roundly/wholly

> まるで風のように走た - Wholly like the wind ran

-   Note: This is hyperbole. Hyperbole in this fashion is common in many languages. In English: &rsquo;I *literally* froze to death&rsquo;. We really mean: &rsquo;I *figuratively* froze to death&rsquo;; The hyperbole is to give emphasis.

We **cannot** use 「まるで」 with 「そうだ」 and we **shouldn&rsquo;t** use it with 「らしい」.

-   のよう\*だ\* - Clause-end adjectival
-   のよう\*な\* - Pre-noun adjectival
-   のよう\*に\* - Adverb

「ようだ」 has a special usage that the other likening phrases don&rsquo;t have. As with the other two we can attach it to the end of a sentence with the meaning of &rsquo;seems/appears&rsquo;. We can also attach it to a complete sentence for another purpose. We can use 「ようだ」 to turn an entire sentence into a simile:

> まるで<sup>1</sup>ゆうれいを見た<sup>2</sup>か<sup>3</sup>のような<sup>4</sup>顔をした<sup>5</sup> - Did (had) a face<sup>5</sup> exactly<sup>1</sup> as<sup>4</sup> if<sup>3</sup> (she) saw a ghost<sup>2</sup> - She made a face exactly as if she&rsquo;d seen a ghost

Note that [2] is an entire sentence being used as a simile for (her) face.

We start with 「まるで」 indicating that we are going to use a simile. Then we make our completed statement. か turns our statement into a question, it gives us our &rsquo;if&rsquo;, she hasn&rsquo;t actually seen a ghost, it&rsquo;s a potentiality, so it&rsquo;s an &rsquo;if&rsquo;. 「のように」 takes this and turns it into a simile &rsquo;as&rsquo; i.e. &rsquo;as strong as&#x2026;&rsquo;, &rsquo;as if&#x2026;&rsquo;. Finally we are describing her face we use the な connective form.

Using か in this way is something we can&rsquo;t do this with any of the other likening phrases. Even 「みたい」 which can do most of the things that 「のよう」 can do, can&rsquo;t do this.

「みたい」 is the less formal cousin of 「よう」 and means &rsquo;looks like&#x2026;&rsquo;, &rsquo;looks&rsquo; not necessarily referring to solely literal vision:

> 山みたいだ

> 山みたいな人

> 風みたいに走る

「みたい」 can also make true similes using 「まるで」 just like 「ように」. The main things to remember about 「みたい」 vs. 「ようだ」 is that 「みたい」 is less formal, and that we **can&rsquo;t** use it with a completed sentence. We **can** use it with a complete sentence for *conjecture*, but not to create a *simile*.

Because 「みたい」 is so casual, often the だ or 「です」 gets left off the sentence.


<a id="org7b17614"></a>

# Lesson 27: Bakari - ばかり

「ばかり」 is essentially a noun, it is used with だ and as we know we can only use だ with nouns, although we will find that sometimes the だ/です is left off in casual speech.

「ばかり」 simply means &rsquo;just&rsquo; or &rsquo;nothing but&rsquo;. One of the most common uses is to place it after a past-tense statement to say that something has &rsquo;just&rsquo; taken place. This is just the same as in English.

> 来たばかり(だ) - I just came

Why do we use the word &rsquo;just&rsquo; in this way (in English and in Japanese)? It&rsquo;s another case of *hyperbole*, just like in the last lesson. When we say &rsquo;just&rsquo; we mean &rsquo;nothing else can have happened in so short a time&rsquo;, obviously this isn&rsquo;t literally true.

We can only attach 「ばかり」 to past-tense actions because in order for something to have &rsquo;just&rsquo; happened it must have well, happened.

The next use of 「ばかり」 expresses that there is a great deal of something. Is this &rsquo;opposite&rsquo; use just random? Once again we do the same thing in English.

We can say that someone or something does &rsquo;nothing but&rsquo; an action by adding 「ばかり」 to the て-form of the word.

> 泣い[1]て[2]ばかり[3] - do[2] nothing but[3] cry[1]

This example could be literal. It could also be exclusively figurative:

> ゴルフをしてばかり - Only plays golf - Just plays golf (In reality they play an awful lot but not *only*)

A conjunction is something that connects two complete logical clauses in a compound sentence.

> ∅がうたった - Sentence 1

> ∅がおどった - Sentence 2

> ∅がうたったばかりかおどった - (A) not only [Sentence 1] but also [Sentence 2]

There is a sense of unexpected or impressive positive or negative cumulation here.

The only only extra thing to understand here is the use of the か-particle. As covered in the last lesson か turns the statement it is attached to into an hypothesis or question. か can also, and especially in colloquial usage turn things into a negative. This is also done in English:

> Do you think I&rsquo;m going to do that? - I&rsquo;m not going to do that!

This is the same in Japanese. Sometimes we put か after something to say that it isn&rsquo;t the case.

> ∅がうたったばかりかおどった - (They) sing just don&rsquo;t, (also) dance. - They don&rsquo;t just sing (but also) dance. - Not only do they sing, they also dance.

The other common conjunction made with 「ばかり」 is 「ばらいに」. に itself can something be added to form a conjunction, like with 「のに」. 「ばかりに」 is an *explanatory* conjunction. It says &rsquo;something happened because&#x2026;&rsquo;. The most common explanatory conjunctions are 「から」 and 「ので」 but 「ばかりに」 has a special implication, it&rsquo;s not simply saying that one thing happened because of something, it&rsquo;s saying that something happened **just** because of something.

> みみか大きいばかりに誰もあそんでくれない - Just because my ears are big no one will play with me


<a id="org24a690e"></a>

# Extra: のに and なのに

「のに」 and 「なのに」 are often used as a sentence ending as well as a conjunction.

「のに」 is a conjunction, something that joins two clauses, each of which could be a complete sentence in of themselves, to form one compound sentence. 「のに」 is an *opposing conjunction*, the main *opposing conjunction* in English is &rsquo;but&rsquo;. We use an opposing conjunction when the second clause stands in opposition to the first clause. The other opposing conjunctions in Japanese are 「けど」 and 「が」.

> お店に行った\*が/けど\*パンがなかった - I went to the shops but there was no bread.

「のに」 is a bit different to these two as it tends to (but doesn&rsquo;t always) imply that the second clause is unsatisfactory, and personally disappointing to the speaker.

> パンがおいしいのにお客さんが來ない - Even though the bread is delicious, the customers don&rsquo;t come.

How does this conjunction become a sentence ender? Grammatically speaking it doesn&rsquo;t. 「のに」 is still always a conjunction, but sometimes the second clause isn&rsquo;t given. These are called *trailing statements*, statements that leave the conclusion unstated (but implied). These are very common in casual speech. Similarly we may often see sentences end with the て-form, grammatically this is wrong as the て-form is also a conjunction, but it&rsquo;s often done nonetheless.

> 赤ちゃんがうるさくて - The baby is/was noisy and so&#x2026;

What this means exactly depends on context, it may mean that we couldn&rsquo;t sleep, or it was embarrassing.

> さくらが約束したのに - Even though Sakura promised&#x2026; (she hasn&rsquo;t done something)

What about 「なのに」? The reason sentences end in 「なのに」is that when we use の we have to use the conjunctive form of だ or 「です」. So when that first clause ends in だ, we have to change it to な in order to put a の after it.

> ∅が晴れた日曜日\*だ\* - It is a sunny Sunday (lit: it is a sunday that became sunny)

> ∅が晴れた日曜日\*な\*のに - It is a sunny Sunday but&#x2026; (I can&rsquo;t go outside etc.) - Even though it is a sunny Sunday (I need to finish my homework etc.)


<a id="org06cf4bb"></a>

# Lesson 28: ようになる, ようにする

When we use a noun followed by 「になる」 we mean that something turns into that noun:

> さくらは∅がかえるになった - Sakura became a from

「よう」 indicates a likeness to something:

> 山のようだ - Like a mountain

When we use 「ようになる」 and the other phrases we don&rsquo;t add them to a noun, but to a complete logical clause:

> (∅が)[かれを信じる]ようになった - (I) came to [believe him] - I became the state of believing him

This is often used with the potential helper verb:

> 日本語のマンガが読\*める\*ようになった - Japanese manga became readable to me

In both cases the state of something is changing. (My) state of not believing became a state of believing, the manga&rsquo;s state of being unreadable became a state of being readable.

「ようにする」 is the *other-move* version of the 「なる」 construction, to make something enter a state:

> まじょがさくらをかえるにした - Witch sakura frog-into did - Witch *turned* Sakura into a frog

> よく見えるようにする - Make (someone/something) look good

「ようにする」 also has an extended use meaning &rsquo;make sure&rsquo;:

> ドアにかぎをかけるようにしてください - Please make it so that (you) lock the door

Related to this is saying something about something that oneself does regularly:

> 毎日歩くようにする - (I) try to make it so that (I) walk every day

Unlike 「ことにする」 (which will be covered next lesson) 「ようにする」 leaves a little wiggle-room or doubt. It&rsquo;s not something guaranteed, but it is the intent, hence &rsquo;try to&rsquo;.

「ように」 can also be used as a conjunction to show *cause-and-effect*. This isn&rsquo;t a separate grammatical usage, it only seems that way from the English translation:

> よく見えるように口べにをつける - Look better, in order that, apply lipstick - Apply lipstick in order to look better

In 「よく見えるようにする」 we&rsquo;re saying to make someone look better without specifying the means, we&rsquo;re just using the catch-all verb 「する」. In the conjunction example, the second clause is simply replacing the catch-all 「する」 with the actual means by which the first clause was accomplished.

One final note is that sometimes ように can be seen on the end of a sentence:

> 日本に行けますように - I wish (someone) could go to Japan

This is most typically seen with 「ます」 sentences, and particularly in prayers or petitions. This is a shortening of 「ようにする」 or 「ようにしてください」.


<a id="orga8e28a4"></a>

# Lesson 29: ことになる, ことにする

As we know 「こと」 refers to an *abstract* thing i.e. a situation or circumstance.

> (∅が)(∅を)けっこんすることにした - (It) became the thing of getting married

What is &rsquo;it&rsquo;? It is the same thing it might be in English, the situation/circumstance in which getting married is the thing.

We have to use 「こと」 here because we cannot attach the logical particle に (or any logical particle) to anything but a noun. So we use 「けっこんする」 as a modifier for 「こと」 in order to give a noun for the situation/circumstance of getting married.

What does this really mean?

> (∅が)(∅を)けっこんすることにした - We decided to get married - We brought about the situation of getting married - We brought about the situation in which getting married was the thing

> (∅が)フランスで留学する(∅が)ことになった - (I) France study (it) thing-in turned into - It became the thing of studying in France - It came about that I studied in France

Because 「ことにする」 is a deliberate act, it is taken in many cases to imply a deliberate decision. Notice however there is no actual decision being made by anyone. 「ことになる」 on the other hand implies that something came about without our control:

> (∅が)(∅を)けっこんすることになた - (It) came about that we&rsquo;re getting married

> (∅が)たいへんあことになった - (It) became a terrible thing

This time 「ことに」 is not being used on a logical clause, just a single word and so does not carry the implication of a decision being made anywhere, as there is no action to be decided on.

# Lesson 30: Japanese conditionals: と

A *conditional* is a statement like &rsquo;if&rsquo; or &rsquo;when&rsquo;. In Japanese there are many conditionals, in this lesson we will just cover と. We&rsquo;ve already covered と as the *exclusive-and* particle. This is exactly the same と as is used for conditionals. It&rsquo;s not the same と as the quotation-particle, but knowing that it is the same と as the exclusive-and particle makes understanding the conditional grammar much clearer.

と is a particle, but it&rsquo;s not a logical particle. It&rsquo;s also not a non-logical particle. Remember that it is an *a-logical* particle, meaning that it carries the meaning of the logical particle attached to the second of the two nouns it connects. In the case of conditionals however, と doesn&rsquo;t attach to a noun, but to a logical clause.

> 冬になる\*と\*寒くなる - When it becomes winter it becomes cold

Why is this connected by と? We&rsquo;re saying that when/if something happens, there is only one result.

と can also be used in a hyperbolic fashion.

> (∅が)それを食べる\*と\*病気になる - Eat that and (you&rsquo;ll) get sick

It is possible that someone might not get sick, but this is a hyperbole, we&rsquo;re trying to say to someone that &rsquo;if you eat that you **will** get sick&rsquo;. &rsquo;If you keep playing those games you **will** fail the exam&rsquo;.

We can also use this と to indicate that something is necessary:

> 行かない\*と\*ダメ - If I don&rsquo;t go it will be bad

> 勉強しないといけない - If I don&rsquo;t study it won&rsquo;t go - If I don&rsquo;t study it won&rsquo;t do - I must study

We may even here the &rsquo;if&rsquo; on it&rsquo;s own without the &rsquo;then&rsquo;:

> 逃げないと! - If we don&rsquo;t run&#x2026; (something bad will happen) - We must run! - Run!

Because と is exclusive, it&rsquo;s a bit more absolute and also a bit more colloquial than other conditionals like ば (to be covered later).


<a id="org599a09b"></a>

# Lesson 31: ば, れば conditional helpers

The と conditional&rsquo;s particular characteristic was its exclusiveness, in many cases we can use the conditionals interchangeably without much changing in terms of meaning, but each conditional does still have its own unique qualities.

The ば/れば conditional is a helper that attached to the え-stem of a verb:

Godan:

-   かう -> かえ\*ば\*
-   きく -> きけ\*ば\*
-   はなす -> はなせ\*ば\*
-   もつ ->  もて\*ば\*
-   しぬ ->  しね\*ば\*
-   とぶ ->  とべ\*ば\*
-   のむ ->  のめ\*ば\*
-   とる ->  とれ\*ば\*

Ichidan:

-   たべる たべ\*れば\*

Irregular:

-   する -> すれば
-   くる -> くれば

For adjectives remove the い and add the helper 「ければ」. 「ない」 -> 「なければ」.

The special characteristic of ば/れば is that is used for *hypotheticals*. They always mean &rsquo;if&rsquo; and can&rsquo;t ever mean &rsquo;when&rsquo;, because we never know for sure if the condition will take place. Consequently, if we use it about something that happened in the past it has to be something that didn&rsquo;t happen, because if it had happened we wouldn&rsquo;t be dealing with a hypothetical.

This hypothetical nature allows ば/れば to be used in many common Japanese expressions:

> どうすればいい？ - How if I act will be good? How act if good? <-> Good if act how?

-   Note: the most apt translation of する most of the time is really &rsquo;act&rsquo;, not &rsquo;do&rsquo;:

> しずかにする - Act quietly

> かさを持ってくればよかった - If I had brought an umbrella, that would&rsquo;ve been good - I should have brought an umbrella

> 勉強しなければいけない - If I don&rsquo;t study it won&rsquo;t go/it won&rsquo;t do - I must/should study

-   Note: There isn&rsquo;t actually a word for &rsquo;must&rsquo; in Japanese, so we always use this &rsquo;If I don&rsquo;t do x it will be bad&rsquo; construction.

Because this is a long winded way of saying something it often gets cut down:

> 。。。しなければ

> 。。。しなけば

Even in very casual speech it is still often said in full to emphasise the &rsquo;must&rsquo;:

> なぜいかなければいけない - Why must I come?


<a id="org795563c"></a>

# Lesson 32: たら, なら conditionals

The 「たら/だら」 conditional is particularly easy to form, all we do is form a verb or an adjective into its 「た/だ」 past form and add ら. 「たら/だら」 is the only conditional that can be used about past events. Of course, if we are referring to something in the past it&rsquo;s not really a conditional. We aren&rsquo;t saying &rsquo;if&rsquo; here, we&rsquo;re saying &rsquo;when&rsquo;. We know that the condition has been fulfilled because it&rsquo;s already happened. What 「たら」 does is show that the event that happened in the past was unexpected or surprising. This is because, rather than using one of the more regular means of showing that one event followed another such as using the て-form or 「から」, we&rsquo;re using an *if-type conditional*. We&rsquo;re stressing the fact that what did happen might well not have happened, and that the thing not having happened might&rsquo;ve been more inline with what we&rsquo;d have expected.

> 家に帰ったらさくらがいた - When I returned to the house, Sakura was there (surprisingly). (She doesn&rsquo;t even have a key, she must&rsquo;ve climbed in through the window. Sakura does that kind of thing from time to time y&rsquo;know)

We can also use 「たら」 on future events. Doing so tends to add stress on what will happen if the condition is fulfilled, as opposed to 「れば」 which poses more stress onto whether or not the condition will be fulfilled, or even the fact that it wasn&rsquo;t fulfilled. Again, 「たら」 is more &rsquo;when&rsquo; than &rsquo;if&rsquo;.

Sometimes the forms 「ったら」 and 「ってば」 to indicate exasperation.

> さくらったら

> さくらってば

What this literally means is a contraction of 「といたら」 or 「といえば」, in other words: &rsquo;When you speak of Sakura&rsquo; i.e. &rsquo;Oh you Sakura&#x2026;&rsquo;, &rsquo;When it&rsquo;s Sakura it&rsquo;s always like this&#x2026;&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s not flattering, it is critical, but it&rsquo;s not very strongly so. It can be quite humorous or joking. 「ってば」 is more likely to express real exasperation and can be put onto more things than just a person&rsquo;s name.

> もう言ったってば - I&rsquo;ve already said that haven&rsquo;t I?&#x2026;

「なら」 is an easy to use particle like helper. All we do is put なら after what we say, which turns it into a conditional. We can put it after nouns and complete logical clauses. If used after a noun we don&rsquo;t need to use the copula (だ) probably because the な of 「なら」 has its roots in the copula itself.

「なら」 can be used on present and future conditionals that aren&rsquo;t in any real doubt at all. For example, if Sakura is worried that something may not be possible to her, we might say:

> さくらなら、できる - If it&rsquo;s Sakura, it will be possible

Of course we know it&rsquo;s Sakura, we&rsquo;re talking to Sakura. So what we&rsquo;re really saying is &rsquo;Since it&rsquo;s Sakura, it will be possible&rsquo;.

> 1.  駅はどこですか - Where is the station
> 2.  駅なら、 あそくです - If it&rsquo;s the station you&rsquo;re asking for, it&rsquo;s over there

Of course there isn&rsquo;t any real doubt that it&rsquo;s the station that we&rsquo;re asking for, so again, &rsquo;since&rsquo;.


<a id="orga4b7232"></a>

# Lesson 33: Japanese limiting terms: だけ, しか, ばかり, のみ


<a id="org4302f17"></a>

## だけ

「だけ」 means &rsquo;limit&rsquo;. Often this is translated as &rsquo;only&rsquo; and in it&rsquo;s most basic form &rsquo;only&rsquo; is what we&rsquo;d say in English, however it&rsquo;s important to realise that in order to understand some of its other uses, it really means &rsquo;limit&rsquo;.

> 1000 円だけ持っている - (I) hold limit-of 1000 yen - I have only 1000 yen

Note: Implication neutral. 「だけ」 functions essentially as a noun. In the set uses given here its particle (in this case を) can be dropped. In many other uses it takes a particle like any other noun.

> できるだけ勉強します - To the limit of the possibility I will study - I will study if I can/as much as I can

At this point if we think of 「だけ」 as &rsquo;only&rsquo; we will begin to get confused. 「できろだけ」 means &rsquo;to the limit of possibility&rsquo;.

> 留学しただけあって英語はうまい - Because of the limit of the fact (I) studied abroad, (my) English is excellent.

This 「あって」 is the connective (て-form) form of 「ある」. The because in the sentence being the て form which remember often implies the cause of the following effect. A common translation of 「だけあって」 is &rsquo;not for nothing&rsquo; but what&rsquo;s actually being said here is &rsquo;precisely because and only because (I) studied abroad (my) English is excellent&rsquo;.

> 安いだけあってすぐに壊れちゃった - Because of the limit of it being cheap it quickly broke - Precisely because it was cheap, it broke quickly

「だけ」 is being used for its ability to limit something down to something precise. Out of all the possible reasons that it could&rsquo;ve broken, it is the reason that it is cheap. We have limited the possibilities down to just one. Again, &rsquo;only&rsquo;.

> 留学しただけあって英語はうまい - Only by studying abroad did I get that good at English

> 留学しただけあって英語はうまい - Only something really cheap would break that quickly


<a id="org6dea5d7"></a>

## しか

「しか」 is often confusing because people are given the impression that it means more or less the same thing as 「だけ」.

> 1000 円だけ持っいない - (I) don&rsquo;t hold more than 1000 ten

Note: Implication of not being enough.
「しか」 means &rsquo;more than&rsquo;, so long as we understand this it is very simple. 「しか」 is only ever used in negative sentences, there is always a 「ない」 or an 「ありません」 when we use 「しか」, so it ends up saying &rsquo;not more than&rsquo;.

「だけ」 doesn&rsquo;t imply that 1000 yen is a lot or a little, it only says that that is what we have and nothing else. 「しか」 implies that the 1000 yen we hold is not enough. &rsquo;I don&rsquo;t have any more than 1000 yen&rsquo; places emphasis on the 1000 yen and it being too little or that if someone wants more they aren&rsquo;t going to get it.

> にげるしかない - There&rsquo;s noting more (we can do) than run - There&rsquo;s nothing for it but to run - There&rsquo;s no other action but to run


<a id="org0e7e48c"></a>

## ばかり

> あのお店はパンだけうる - The shop only sells bread

> あのお店はパンしかうらない - That shops doesn&rsquo;t sell anything but bread

> あのお店はパンばかりうる - That shop sells an awful lot of bread

「ばかり」 and 「だけ」 have the same literal meaning (only/just) but as we learned in the lesson on ばかり, it&rsquo;s a hyperbole, we don&rsquo;t literally mean it only sells bread. Just that it sells bread far more than anything else.


<a id="org7b163d9"></a>

## のみ

「のみ」 is just 「だけ」 in its simplest sense i.e. &rsquo;only&rsquo;.

> あのお店はパンのみうる - The shop only sells bread

「のみ」 is typically used in polite or formal contexts, otherwise 「だけ」 is used.

# Lesson 34: Understand any sentence

As we know the fundamental core of Japanese is what we covered in the very first lesson. There is always an A carriage (a noun) marked by が (which we may not be able to see) and a B (う/だ/い) engine that we can always see.

In English these are called the Subject and the Predicate, in Japanese the 主語(しゅご) and the 述語(じゅつご).


<a id="orgff913a7"></a>

## How do we know when a logical clause ends? (How do we identify a logical clause?)

Sentences where there is more than one logical clause **must** be contain some kind of conjunction. There are many kinds of conjunction, many we have covered already:

-   If/When ~ たら、 なら、 ば
-   And/but ~ そして、 けど
-   Because ~ から、 ので

We also need to look out for the verb/adjective clause conjunctions:

-   て-form
-   い-stem

Remember the い-stem of a verb is the main conjunctive stem out of the four verb stems. It can connect nouns to verbs, other verbs to verbs, and various helpers to verbs. It can also connect one logical clause to another.

In Japanese a sentence has to end with an engine:

-   う (A verb)
-   い (an adjective)
-   だ (the copula, can&rsquo;t be な because then it&rsquo;s modifying a noun, not powering a sentence)

The sentence will always end with an engine except for if there are one or two *sentence ender particles* (They are not part of the logical sentence).

How do we find, or how do we eliminate the possibility of a compound sentence? Just as before, a logical clause must end with an engine, and if the sentence is compound it must end also with a connector.

# Lesson 35: より, の ほう, いっぽう

> マアリ\*より\*さくら\*のほう\*がきれいだ - Sakura is prettier than Mary


<a id="orgd8952e7"></a>

## より

「より」 is a non-logical particle (it doesn&rsquo;t have to be attached to a noun). It can go after just about anything, a complete logical clause, a noun, an adjective, whatever. It&rsquo;s most basic meaning is &rsquo;from&rsquo;:

> さくらより - From Sakura

「より」 means &rsquo;from&rsquo;, we already have another word meaning &rsquo;from&rsquo;, 「から」. The difference between the two is that 「から」 marks the &rsquo;A&rsquo; in &rsquo;A from B&rsquo; in such a way that it is treating &rsquo;A&rsquo; as the starting point, or point of origin:

> 日本からきました - I came/come from Japan - Japan is my point of origin

This often gains the metaphorical meaning of &rsquo;because&rsquo;, as &rsquo;some event&rsquo; is the point of origin for &rsquo;some other event&rsquo;:

> さむいからコートをきる - Because it&rsquo;s cold I wear a coat

「より」 means &rsquo;from&rsquo; in a very different sense. The directional metaphor is concentrating not on the origin of &rsquo;A from B&rsquo; but in the distance/difference of &rsquo;A from B&rsquo;.

> さくらはメアリよりきれいだ - From Mary, Sakura is pretty - Distinguished from Mary, Sakura is pretty

We are still using 「メアリ」 as the &rsquo;base point&rsquo;, the point of comparison, and because of this comparative nature we&rsquo;re **not** saying that &rsquo;Sakura is pretty while Mary isn&rsquo;t&rsquo;, we&rsquo;re saying that &rsquo;taking Mary as the point of comparison, Sakura is pretty (therefore more pretty i.e. prettier)&rsquo;. Notice how this has the same meaning as the original sentence 「マアリ\*より\*さくら\*のほう\*がきれいだ」 without needing to use 「ほう」.

We can also use 「より」 in other contexts:

> 今年の冬はいつもより寒い - Comparing from always, this year&rsquo;s winter is cold - This year&rsquo;s winter is colder than usual.

-   Note: &rsquo;always&rsquo; is a kind of hyperbole in a way

> さくらは人より傾い - Sakura is clever compared to people - Sakura is clever compared to (most) people - Sakura is smarter than most


<a id="org4a713be"></a>

## ほう

「ほう」 is quite different from 「より」 and 「から」. It&rsquo;s not a particle, it is a noun, hence 「のほう」. It&rsquo;s literal meaning is &rsquo;direction&rsquo; or &rsquo;side&rsquo;. When it means &rsquo;side&rsquo; it means &rsquo;side&rsquo; in the sense of direction, not in the sense of &rsquo;edge&rsquo;.

The idea of &rsquo;side&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t limited to physical spaces, but concepts as well. Also, by nature of there being &rsquo;a&rsquo; side it is implied that there is another side to contrast with. Two sides of a coin and all that.

「ほう」 can follow a noun as in 「さくらのほう」 or we can put it after a verb or adjective, in which case the verb/adjective is describing 「ほう」.

> 1.  メアリがきれいだと思う？ - Do you think Mary is pretty
> 2.  さくらの\*ほう\*がきれいだ。- The side of Sakura is pretty - I think Sakura is prettier

Once again this is a *comparative* structure, we&rsquo;re **not** saying that Sakura is pretty and Mary isn&rsquo;t, only that &rsquo;the side of&rsquo; Sakura is prettier than &rsquo;the side of&rsquo; Mary.

Notice again how we don&rsquo;t need 「より」 here, just as before we didn&rsquo;t need 「ほう」 to express the same thing.

A lot of the time 「より」 and 「ほう」 will be used individually. When they&rsquo;re being used together it&rsquo;s usually either formal or adding emphasis.


<a id="org5e6df22"></a>

## いっぽう 一方

Another use of 「ほう」 is in the expression 「いっぽう」 which means &rsquo;one side&rsquo; or &rsquo;one direction&rsquo;. Often we see this in narrative, sometimes at the very start of a sentence, or even the start of a paragraph or entire chapter.

What 「いっぽう」 is doing is essentially the same as the English &rsquo;meanwhile&rsquo;. 「いっぽう」 does **not** mean &rsquo;meanwhile&rsquo; because it doesn&rsquo;t. &rsquo;Meanwhile&rsquo; is a *time-expression* meaning &rsquo;at the same time&rsquo;. 「いっぽう」 while performing the same function does it quite differently. It&rsquo;s really saying, &rsquo;All that (the previous sentence/paragraph/chapter) was one side, now we&rsquo;re going to look at the other side&rsquo;.

Just like 「でも」 it wraps up whatever came before it with で which is the て-form of 「です」 (all that was existing), with the contrastive function of も to give &rsquo;but&rsquo;. 「いっぽう」 often drops the copula で however.

> この辺りは静かな一方で不便だ - It&rsquo;s quiet around here, but it&rsquo;s inconvenient - On one hand it&rsquo;s quiet, but on the other it&rsquo;s inconvenient

-   Note: Remember な is the connective form of だ.

Another use of 「いっぽう」 is that it can also be used after a complete verbal clause to show that something that is happening is continuing in one direction.

> この村の人口が減る一方 - This village&rsquo;s population is declining (and declining and declining) - This village&rsquo;s population just keeps on declining


<a id="org9332dee"></a>

# Lesson 36: ところ - The Japanese concept of place

「ところ」 「所」 means &rsquo;place&rsquo;. It means a literal place and also takes on slightly metaphorical uses like: 「わたしのところ」 - My place - My apartment (etc.).

In Japanese the *figurative* sense of place goes a lot further than it does in English. For example

> さくらのどこが好きなの？ - lit: Sakura&rsquo;s where do (you) like - What place of Sakura do (you) like?

An appropriate answer to this might be 「やさしだ」 - &rsquo;She&rsquo;s gentle&rsquo; i.e. &rsquo;The place that I like about her is that she&rsquo;s gentle&rsquo;, &rsquo;(One of) Sakura&rsquo;s good places is that she&rsquo;s gentle&rsquo;. &rsquo;Place&rsquo; here doesn&rsquo;t mean anything at all like a physical location, it means an aspect of something, even if that aspect is very abstract.

> 1.  わかりましたか？ - Did you understand it?
> 2.  分かるところがあったが分からないところもありました - There were places I understood and places I didn&rsquo;t understand

Notice that this is closer to a usage of &rsquo;place&rsquo; we have in English. Don&rsquo;t get mixed up however, we aren&rsquo;t saying &rsquo;there were times I didn&rsquo;t understand&rsquo;, we&rsquo;re saying &rsquo;there were aspects/subtleties I didn&rsquo;t understand&rsquo;.

Place is also often used to mean a place not in space but in time. We can use 「ところ」 with &rsquo;A does B&rsquo; sentences in all three tenses.

> 昼ごはんを食べるところだ - I&rsquo;m just about to eat lunch - (It (The present time) is) (I&rsquo;m) just about to eat lunch place.

-   Note: This is an &rsquo;A is B&rsquo; sentence with a だ-engine, but the original sentence the construction comes from is an &rsquo;A does B&rsquo; sentence 「∅が昼ごはんを食べる」

> 昼ごはんを食べているところだ - I&rsquo;m eating lunch right now

> 昼ごはんを食べたところだ - I just ate lunch

-   Note: In all of these examples the 「ところだ」 is adding an immediateness to the place in time something is/will/was happening. I **just** ate, I&rsquo;m eating **right now**, I&rsquo;m **just about to** eat.

We could easily also say:

> 昼ごはんを食べたばかりだ - I just ate lunch

Sometimes a few corners of this structure are cut. As with many regular set expressions 「だ」 can be cut off. 「ところ」 can also be shortened to just 「とこ」.

> なごやに着陸したとこ - I just landed at Nagoya

Remember: Even though we&rsquo;ve been covering examples of time, 「ところ」 does still mean place.

> いいところに来たね! - You came to a good place didn&rsquo;t you!

But it can mean either:

> いいところに来たね! - You came at a good time didn&rsquo;t you!


<a id="orgcd94359"></a>

# Lesson 37: Structure, な vs の, なる & たる adjectives


<a id="org1154d57"></a>

## する verbs

> 勉強をする - To do studying

-   Note: &rsquo;Do&rsquo; (する) acting on the noun of &rsquo;studying&rsquo;.

> 勉強する - Study

-   Note: する and 勉強 fused together to form a &rsquo;true&rsquo; verb


<a id="org11e179d"></a>

## なる & たる &rsquo;adjectives&rsquo;

> 華麗なる探偵 - Magnificent detectives

「華麗」 is an adjectival noun so it could&rsquo;ve been used with な, but the author has chosen to use 「なる」 instead. 「なる」 is not the same 「なる」 that means &rsquo;become&rsquo;, it is a contraction of 「のある」.

> 華麗がある探偵 -> 華麗のある探偵 -> 華麗なる探偵 - Detectives possessing magnificence lit: Magnificence exists detectives

What does the choice of 「なる」 over な actually mean? In modern texts the only reason to choose 「なる」 over な is just that it sounds a bit more old-fashioned or a bit more literary.

「たる」 is a contraction of 「とある」, meaning that the 「ある」 is belonging to the thing that is being described, rather than the thing describing it.

> らんらんたる目 - Blazing eyes

The subtle difference is that 「なる」 means &rsquo;is magnificent&rsquo;, whereas 「たる」 means &rsquo;in a blazing manner&rsquo;.


<a id="org4e53ccf"></a>

## All-kanji groups

(Most of the time) we can assume that any word with no おくりがな (that is kana following a set of kanji) is a noun. What is happening when there are large groups of just kanji?

Most of the time this is one noun modifying another noun. We have seen ways in which nouns modify each-other via な-の-なる-たる. They can also modify each-other directly i.e. 「日本」 + 「語」 = 「日本語」. This works in just the same way as English: &rsquo;Book&rsquo; + &rsquo;Shelf&rsquo; = &rsquo;Bookshelf&rsquo;. Japanese goes much further with this and has many many combinations that don&rsquo;t exist in English.


<a id="orgbce1065"></a>

# Extra: が particle becomes の in subordinate clauses

The の particle can replace the が particle in &rsquo;subordinate clauses&rsquo;.

Remember, the の particle the the possessive particle, and is the only particle that has an exact equivalent in English: *&rsquo;s*.

> さくら\*の\*ぼうし - Sakura\*&rsquo;s\* hat

Let&rsquo;s look at a sentence where の can replace が.

> 私がたべたケーキは(∅が)おいしかった - The cake I ate was delicious

Remember, The が particle marks the thing doing/being something in the sentence. &rsquo;I&rsquo; am eating the cake, so &rsquo;I&rsquo; am marked by が. In this sentence, the main が is not actually visible, it is the invisible ∅-pronoun &rsquo;it&rsquo; (the cake).

This is the kind of sentence in which we can use の in place of が. We **can&rsquo;t** use の for the main が of a sentence, we can only use it for an *adjectival が*.

Let&rsquo;s look at an English equivalent:

> Sakura&rsquo;s shouting at the waiter upset me

&rsquo;Sakura&rsquo;s shouting at the waiter&rsquo; is a noun, and it is the thing that did the act of upsetting me. The shouting belongs to Sakura because she is the one that did it. This is very similar to the Japanese, only the Japanese doesn&rsquo;t turn the logical clause into a noun but into an adjective:

> 私のたべたケーキは(∅が)おいしかった - My eaten cake is delicious


<a id="org053de4f"></a>

# Lesson 38: じゃない, ではない

Japanese often contains what appears to be negative statements, when what is meant are really positive statements. For example:

> さくらじゃない - That isn&rsquo;t Sakura

Really this means:

> さくらじゃない - That&rsquo;s Sakura isn&rsquo;t it? - That **is** Sakura

What is 「じゃない」?  「じゃない」 is a contraction of 「ではない」 which is the negative of the copula (だ).

> これは(∅が)ペンではない - As for this, as for being a pen (ペンだ), isn&rsquo;t

So, grammatically 「さくらじゃない」 is in fact a negative statement. Negative questions are used in most languages:

> Nice day, **isn&rsquo;t** it?

A question like &rsquo;Are you Sakura&rsquo;, is neutral, there is no suggestion of whether we expect them to or not to be Sakura. &rsquo;You&rsquo;re Sakura aren&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; however shows that we expect the person to be in fact Sakura.

The confusing part is that only in formal speech would we explicitly mark the question i.e:

> さくらじゃないですか

か is not used as a sentence-ending question marker in this way in non-formal Japanese.

「さくらじゃない」therefore has three possible meanings, a statement, a question, or a third meaning, each indicated by tone.

> さくらじゃない - Not Sakura

> さくらじゃない - Sakura isn&rsquo;t it?

> さくらじゃない - If it isn&rsquo;t Sakura!

This use of tone (./?/!) is just the same in English.

「じゃない」 can also be used as a negative-question sentence-ender in a similar sense as ね:

> 暑いじゃない - It&rsquo;s hot isn&rsquo;t it (expecting agreement)

> 暑いね - It&rsquo;s hot isn&rsquo;t it (expecting agreement)

-   Note: 「暑いじゃない」 is not the negative of 「暑い」 which is 「暑くない」

「じゃない」 can also be used after verbs:

> もう言ったじゃない - I already said that didn&rsquo;t I?

「じゃない」 itself is often reduced to just 「じゃん」

> 寒いじゃん - It&rsquo;s cold isn&rsquo;t it

All of these expressions are very colloquial and aren&rsquo;t in fact grammatically correct. Remember, 「じゃない」 = 「ではない」 which is the negative form of the copula だ, and だ can only be used with nouns.

There are of course more formal ways of using 「ではない」 as a positive statement but these of course tidy up the grammar

> その理論が間違っている\*の\*ではないでしょうか - Might that theory not be in error?

-   Note: This may be used as an assertion. Once we have definitively proven something, we may finish with this as a short of challenge.


<a id="orgcc720b2"></a>

# Lesson 39: Buried questions

か is used to mark questions, but not what we might usually think of as a question. For example

> さくらが来るかわからない - I don&rsquo;t know if Sakura will come - Sakura will come? I don&rsquo;t know

> さくらが来るか知っていますか - Do you know if Sakura is coming?

か displaces logical particles much of the time:
Normal structure:

-   XX が分からない
-   XX を知っています

Logical particles displaced by か:

-   XX か分からない
-   XX か知っています

か is also used in the common expression 「かどうか」 which means &rsquo;whether or not&rsquo;:

> さくらが来るかどうか分からない - I don&rsquo;t know whether Sakura&rsquo;s coming or not

Precisely 「かどうか」 means &rsquo;&#x2026;? how? &#x2026;&rsquo; i.e. 「さくらが来るかどうか分からない」 - I don&rsquo;t know if Sakura&rsquo;s coming or how it will be.

From this usage we can see how we can use か to mean &rsquo;or&rsquo;:

> お茶かコーヒーどちらがいい？ - Which is good, tea or coffee?


<a id="org4f6685a"></a>

## かもしれない - Maybe

-   XX か - The question/proposition XX
-   も - As much as
-   しれ - え-stem of 知る (know) indicating potential (lesson 10)
-   ない - Negative helper adjective

-> The question of XX, I cannot go so far as to know = Maybe XX


<a id="org200e1c4"></a>

## かな - I wonder

> さくらが来るかな - I wonder if Sakura will come

-   か bundles the question
-   な address the question to oneself


<a id="org8c4761b"></a>

## か is a nominaliser

> まるで[ゆうれいを見た]\*かの\*ような顔をした - A face as if one had seen a ghost

Notice how か has turned 「ゆうれいを見た」 into a quasi-noun that can take の.


<a id="org0379872"></a>

## もんか & ものですか

In certain expressions か calls into question (denies) a proposition

> 格好に行くもんか - I&rsquo;m not going to school

「ものですか」 and 「もんか」 literally mean &rsquo;Is that a thing&rsquo;, this is the same kind of negativising question we have in English i.e. &rsquo;Do you think I&rsquo;m going to do that?&rsquo;

Note how this is one of the few uses of か as a sentence ending question marker in non-formal speech. This is because of it&rsquo;s purposefully rough nature.

Another place we often see か as a negativising question marker is in 「どころか」. Remember 「どころ」is a form of 「ところ」 and means place/time/circumstance/condition. When said as 「どころ」it&rsquo;s usually negative.

> 漢字が読めるどころかひらがなも読めない - Far from kanji being possible (for me) to read, even hiragana isn&rsquo;t read-possible - Not only can&rsquo;t I read kanji, I can&rsquo;t even read hiragana

What is 「どころ」 doing here? It&rsquo;s dealing with the concept of reading kanji and negativising it. &rsquo;The circumstances in which I could read kanji aren&rsquo;t&rsquo;, &rsquo;Not only has the situation not reached this far place, it hasn&rsquo;t even read this near place&rsquo;.


<a id="orga2c1536"></a>

# Extra: Sentence ender particles


<a id="org6d91cdc"></a>

## ね

ね is a marker for information that the speaker assume the listener to know already. It is the marker for shared information/feelings.


<a id="org194324d"></a>

## よ

よ is the opposite of ね. ね marks information that one assumes the listener to already know, よ marks information that one assumes the listener doesn&rsquo;t already know.

よ can be assertive, and can be used to contradict, but most of the time it&rsquo;s a friendly particle that introduces some information the listener doesn&rsquo;t know but you think they will be interested in.


<a id="org2f92a05"></a>

## よね

This might seem a little confusing at first, notice however it&rsquo;s よね, you can&rsquo;t say ねよ. The reason for this is that you&rsquo;re introducing the listener to something that they don&rsquo;t know, and then immediately treating that information as shared.


<a id="org29069ca"></a>

## な

な is not really a particle in terms of Japanese grammar, it&rsquo;s *technically* an exclamation, but it functions in much the same way. In a previous lesson many sentence-enders involving な were discussed, in each of these cases な was the connective for of だ. This な is different.

While ね marks information known to the listener, よ marks information unknown to the listener, な marks a remark that is addressed to oneself.

> 暑いな - Gosh it&rsquo;s hot

One may be intending to share this statement with someone else.

な can also be used within a sentence, hence why even though technically an exclamation it functions like a particle, marking that something is directed at oneself.

There are also occasions where men will use な where women would use ね. In these cases the difference in meaning is &rsquo;You agree with me don&rsquo;t you&rsquo; for ね and &rsquo;Well that&rsquo;s what I think and I don&rsquo;t care if you agree with me or not&rsquo; for な.


<a id="org850a896"></a>

## かな

&rsquo;I wonder&rsquo;. XX か(question)な(directs question at oneself).


<a id="org10410f2"></a>

# Lesson 40: Japanese structure pitfalls


<a id="orge4033ff"></a>

## で

で as we know is a logical particle that like all logical particles marks a noun and tells us that that noun is the means by which some action was accomplished of the place at which some action occurred.

There is another で however which is **not** a particle, and is also used very frequently with adjectival nouns:

> さくらがきれい\*で\*やさしい - Sakura is pretty **and** kind

「きれい」 is an adjectival noun (な-adjective):

> きれいだ - is pretty

> 花がきれいだ - Flower is pretty

> きれいな花 - Pretty flower

> 花がきれいで - Flower is pretty and&#x2026;

The final of these example is the て-form of だ.

With a true adjective we also use the て-form, but of the adjective, not of だ (だ is for nouns).

> さくらが美しくてやさしい - Sakura is beautiful and kind

Some more examples:

> お元気で - Keep well

The particle で doesn&rsquo;t make any sense here. Remember the て-form is often used to make an imperitive, to tell or ask someone to do something: 「待って!」 - Wait!

> 無事でよかったね - It&rsquo;s good that you weren&rsquo;t hurt

Here is an example of the て-form of だ being used as a connective: &rsquo;You weren&rsquo;t hurt - that&rsquo;s good&rsquo;


<a id="org2c87991"></a>

## が

As we know the が particle is in every japanese sentence, whether we can see it or not.

There is a second が, which functions as a (usually contrastive) clause connector:

> お店に行った\*が\*パンがなかった - I went to the shops **but** there wasn&rsquo;t any bread.

It isn&rsquo;t possible to confuse these two が s because the particle が can only ever mark a noun, and the clause connector が can only mark a complete clause (which cannot end in a noun).

が doesn&rsquo;t have to be contrastive, most of the time it is, but it can be used just as a regular, non-contrastive conjunction.

Also: sometimes this が will be used at the end of a sentence to soften a request.

> コーヒーがほしいが - I&rsquo;d like some coffee - I&rsquo;d like some coffee but (if it&rsquo;s any trouble it&rsquo;s not necessary)


<a id="org567c3a9"></a>

## に

に is the targeting particle. There is also another に that functions the same as と (and). This に is more prevalent in older Japanese texts.

It is further used in certain expressions like 「それに」 (furthermore) leveraging the &rsquo;and&rsquo; quality of に to be a clause connector.


<a id="org20e836b"></a>

# Lesson 41: Japanese structure key facts

New info:

-   する nouns (verbs) can drop the を particle to form a &rsquo;true&rsquo; する verb


<a id="org64f545c"></a>

## Adverbial nouns

Adverbial nouns can make に or と disappear when used as an adverb. Often (but not always) these nouns end in り.

As we know, any noun that can be used adverbially can be done so using the particle に. 「しずかにする」 - Act quietly. With an adverbial noun we don&rsquo;t need the に:

> ゆっくりにする - Act leisurely

> ゆっくりする - Act leisurely

「あまり」 is a noun that means &rsquo;excess&rsquo;. We can use it in a literal sense: 「ごはんのあまり」 - The excess rice.

> 悲しみのあまりに泣いた - From sadness&rsquo;s excess, cried

> 悲しみのあまり泣いた - From sadness&rsquo;s excess, cried

> あまり勉強しない - lit: (I) don&rsquo;t study too much. read: (I) don&rsquo;t study *very* much

-   Note: This under-exaggeration is another case of hyperbole (or rather inverse-hyperbole).

「ずいぶん」 means &rsquo;sufficiently&rsquo;. In English &rsquo;sufficiently&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t a noun, but in Japanese it is. Like 「あまり」 is often used with some inverse-hyperbole i.e. sufficiently = more than sufficient.


<a id="org09fb270"></a>

# Lesson 42: まま

「まま」 is a noun. What &rsquo;thing&rsquo; is it? It&rsquo;s an unchanged condition:
\#+BEGIN<sub>QUOTE</sub>:
自然のままの森 - Nature&rsquo;s unchanged-condition&rsquo;s forest - A forest in its natural state
\#+END<sub>QUOTE</sub>
\#+BEGIN<sub>QUOTE</sub>:
そのままで食べられるの？ - That unchanged state-being, eat-able-does? - Can you eat them just as they are?
\#+END<sub>QUOTE</sub>

-   Note: This で is the copula (だ)

\#+BEGIN<sub>QUOTE</sub>:
そのまま食べられるの？ - That unchanged state-being, eat-able-does? - Can you eat them just as they are?
\#+END<sub>QUOTE</sub>

-   Note: we can drop the で see the previous lesson

「まま」 being an unchanged state, in cases where the state could change (like uncooked food becoming cooked) we&rsquo;re essentially using as a time period. Therefore we can ignore the copula like a time expression:
\#+BEGIN<sub>QUOTE</sub>:
そのまま食べられるの？ - While they&rsquo;re uncooked, can they be eaten?
\#+END<sub>QUOTE</sub>

\#+BEGIN<sub>QUOTE</sub>:
パジャマのまま朝ごはんを食べる - Pyjama&rsquo;s unchanged state eat breakfast - Eat breakfast while still in pyjamas
\#+END<sub>QUOTE</sub>

\#+BEGIN<sub>QUOTE</sub>:
いつまでも若いままでいたい - Forever young unchanged-state-be exist-desire - I&rsquo;d like to stay young forever
\#+END<sub>QUOTE</sub>
Notice how the adjective 「わかい」 is modifying 「まま」 (because it&rsquo;s a noun).

「思いのまま」 and 「心のまま」 are common uses of 「まま」. What this means is &rsquo;The unchanged condition that&rsquo;s in our thoughts/heart&rsquo;. This phrase is always applied to something outside of our thoughts/heart (i.e. not imaginary), and expresses that that thing is the same as how we &rsquo;think/feel&rsquo;. What this means therefore is making the outside world conform to our thoughts/desires.
\#+BEGIN<sub>QUOTE</sub>:
思いのままに動けない - In unchanged state of my thoughts, move-possible-not - I cannot move in the way I think I should
\#+END<sub>QUOTE</sub>
Remember: Sometimes 「思い」 does imply desire:
\#+BEGIN<sub>QUOTE</sub>:
片思い - One-sided-thought (unrequited love)
\#+END<sub>QUOTE</sub>


<a id="org29ffb2a"></a>

# Lesson 43: Cut through the confusion

This is a good lesson but not much worth taking notes on.

The general gist is that Japanese does not make much distinction between the actor of a sentence and the receiver. Things that are passive/non-passive can be the other depending on what is being spoken about. Often the concept of there being an &rsquo;object&rsquo; and an &rsquo;actor&rsquo; or an inducer and an induced is meaningless, as the act is a shared thing between the two.


<a id="orgbbf6780"></a>

# Lesson 44: Chau, Chatta, ちゃう、 ちゃった

「ちゃう」 and 「ちゃった」 are contractions of the verb 「しまう」 meaning to finish/complete:

-   。。。てしまう -> ちゃう
-   。。。 てしまった -> ちゃった

「しまう」 can be formed into the い-stem 「しまい」 making it a noun, meaning &rsquo;the finish&rsquo;/&rsquo;the ending&rsquo;. This past tense of this is 「しまった」 which can be used all on its own as an expression meaning &rsquo;something&rsquo;s gone very wrong&rsquo;​/&rsquo;this is not at all satisfactory&rsquo;.

We can use this expression as a helper verb that we can attach to the て-form of another verb. This て + 「しまった」 gets contracted to ちゃった. If the て-form is で instead of て then 「ちゃった」 becomes 「じゃった」 just as 「では」 becomes 「じゃ」.

This can be used for a much wider range of things than just regret. To help understand all the varies uses of this expression, think of the English word &rsquo;done&rsquo;. (Another given example that maybe works better is &rsquo;totally&rsquo;).

We also use this about future things, with a similar feeling as &rsquo;done&rsquo; is used for the past.

<a id="org5ba497b"></a>

# Lesson 46: Japanese word order

As sentences become more and more complex, understanding word order becomes more necessary to understand what is going on.

English is a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) language. &rsquo;Susan hit Mary&rsquo; does not have the same meaning as &rsquo;Mary hit Susan&rsquo;. In Japanese the question of who did what to whom is answered by the logical particles, not by the order of the words in the sentence.

As we have learned however there are still rules about what order words must come in Japanese sentences. This order is according to two simple rules:

1.  The &rsquo;engine&rsquo; always goes at the end of the sentence
    1.  any engine that does not come at the end of a sentence must be modifying a noun
2.  Anything that modifies any noun always comes before it

Point 2 is similar to English in simple cases. &rsquo;Warm day&rsquo;, &rsquo;nice dress&rsquo;, but in complex cases the modifier comes after the noun: &rsquo;(the) dress I bought on Saturday&rsquo;. In Japanese the modifiers **always** come before the noun.

Point 1a:

> いちばで(∅が)青いドレスを買った - I bought a blue dress at the market

We know this is a complete logical clause because of rule 1.

> いちばで(∅が)買ったドレス - The dress that I bought at the market&#x2026;

Not a logical clause, but a modified noun

> (∅が)ドレスを買ったいちばで - The market at which I bought the dress&#x2026;

Again, not a logical clause but a modified noun


<a id="org7e592c6"></a>

# Lesson 47: Secret weapon for breaking down sentences

The gist is that A and B (as in A is B or A does B) are themselves the entire sentence (a logical clause), nothing else is really going on than what A is or what A does. Everything else in the sentence is just extra information about the thing that is or is doing and the thing that it is or is being done.

There is an addendum to last week&rsquo;s lesson:

1.  Anything that modifies any <del>noun</del> thing (noun or head-verb) always comes before it

If the が marked A isn&rsquo;t visible, then there is nothing modifying it (sounds obvious but this hadn&rsquo;t clicked until it had been said).

The structure of every sentence, in order goes:

1.  Modifiers of the A car (optional (if there is a visible A car))
2.  The A car (may not be visible)
3.  Modifiers of the B engine (optional)
4.  The B engine

Remember: the 4 logical particles aside from が (に、 で、 を、 へ) all modify the B engine, if we see them before the A car, then they must be part of a clause modifying the A car.

Remember: modifiers can be entire clauses in their own right.

# Lesson 48: Dealing with ambiguity

Japanese has a reputation of being ambiguous.

The first thing that makes japanese confusing to foreigners is the ∅ pronoun. The ∅ pronoun is really no more confusing than English &rsquo;it&rsquo;, both require context to know what they are.

There are three rules for busting ambiguity (and they are not different than the rules we use in English):

1.  Context
2.  Probability
3.  Absurdity


<a id="org5f55879"></a>

# Lesson 49: Japanese point-of-view - もらう, てもらう

「もらう」 means to &rsquo;download&rsquo;.

When used with a noun it does not imply a giver of the thing we are receiving, unlike kureru and ageru which are bound to a particular giver and receiver.

When used with a verb, kureru implies that the giver took the initiative, whereas morau implies that the receiver took the initiative.

Even though no giver is implied, when a giver is mentioned, the giver is marked by に, this is the same as the receptive helper verb れる/られる, もらう like the receptive helper verb are &rsquo;pull&rsquo; actions rather than &rsquo;pull&rsquo; actions, in a push sentence the に marks the indirect object, the ultimate receiver of the action, whereas in a pull sentence the に marks the source of the action.

> ∅がメイリーにボールを投げた - I threw the ball **at** Mary

-   に marks the target of が-marked subject&rsquo;s action

> ∅がメイリーにボールを投げられた - I throw-received the ball **from** Mary

-   に marks the source of が-marked subject&rsquo;s action

&#x2014;

> ∅がお医者さんに見てもらう - (I) will have a doctor see me

-   Doctor does seeing
-   が-marked actor does receiving

> 散髪をしてもらう - Receive a haircut

-   No implication of from whom

The person もらう-ing does not have to be the speaker:

> 散髪をしてもらったほうがいい - (You) should get your haircut

Kureru cannot be used for someone other than oneself/one&rsquo;s group, but もらう is not.


<a id="orgbc81ce9"></a>

# Lesson 50: させてもらう

There are many expressions that combine 「てもらう」 (see previous lesson) with the causative helper verb 「せる/させる」, 「させてもらう」.


<a id="org1b33377"></a>

## The hidden secret of the causative helper

Refer to lesson 19 for a recap of the causative helper verb. There is one extra aspect that will be covered here:

When we attach the causative helper verb to another verb, what we are saying is that someone caused someone to do that verb. Something that confuses English speakers is that this can mean to allow someone to do it, or to make/compel someone to do it. The causative verb in-of-itself doesn&rsquo;t draw a distinction between those two. The causative helper can mean make, and it can mean allow, and it can mean either. It simply means &rsquo;cause&rsquo;. It does not specify the means by which someone is &rsquo;caused&rsquo;.

There is a note here about there being no &rsquo;cause&rsquo; expression in English, which is sometimes made up for with &rsquo;let&rsquo; as in: &rsquo;let me know&rsquo;:

> 知る - to know
> 知らせる - cause to know (let know)

The causative can be used in many other ways that mean neither &rsquo;make&rsquo; nor &rsquo;allow&rsquo;:

> 聞かせる - cause to hear

> あとで聞かせよう - Tomorrow will cause you to hear (I&rsquo;ll tell you tomorrow)

> 読み聞かせる - Read and cause to hear (Read aloud)


<a id="org361e829"></a>

## させてもらう

> 聞か-せて-もら-え-ます-か - hear-cause-receive-possible-formal-question - Is it possible to receive (your) causing (me) to hear, kind sir? (Can you tell me?)

> 学生でも下宿させてもらえませんか - Student even-if, caused-to-lodge receive-possible is not, good madam? Even if one is a student, is it not possible to receive being caused to lodge here? (Do you take students?)

> ∅がメガネを合わせてもらった - (I) glasses caused-to-fit received (I was fitted for glasses)

Sometimes this can mean &rsquo;allow&rsquo;:

> 帰らせてもらいます - (I) will receive (your) allowing (me) to go home


<a id="org4a872db"></a>

## 敬語 (polite)

All though we aren&rsquo;t yet covering polite speech, the polite form of もらう is いただく (or as this is polite speech is usually used with ます so) いただきます. We are used to this phrase before eating, but what it really means is something like &rsquo;I humbly receive&rsquo;.

# Lesson 51: How to read a Japanese Kaidan (ghost story)

\#+BEGIN<sub>QUOTE</sub>:
それは ある女の子が先輩のアパートで行われた飲み会に参加した日
\#+END<sub>QUOTE</sub>

-   それは is the equivalent of English &rsquo;it was&rsquo;. There is no &rsquo;it&rsquo; in Japanese, so when we want to introduce a scene (like in the start of a story) and say &rsquo;it was a cold night&rsquo; or something similar we use &rsquo;that&rsquo; &#x2013; &rsquo;as for that&#x2026;&rsquo; = &rsquo;it was&#x2026;&rsquo;
-   日 It is not immediately clear what the engine of this sentence is, there is no だ, no adjective and no verb. However, since it ends in a noun we can know that this is an A is B sentence, and that the copula (だ) has been dropped. This happens very often in casual speech.
-   The sentence is tenseless (no copula to tell), we can tell the tense however because the purpose of this sentence is to set the scene for a story, so it&rsquo;d be in the past tense.
-   Sentence core: &rsquo;It was a day&rsquo;

\#+BEGIN<sub>QUOTE</sub>:
ある女の子が先輩のアパートで行われた飲み会に
\#+END<sub>QUOTE</sub>

-   This entire block is a single modifier for the day. We know this because a verb (the engine of the clause) connects directly to a noun.
-   The core of this clause is clearly 「女の子が参加した」 - Girl who took part
-   Remember ある here means &rsquo;a certain&rsquo;
-   飲み会 - drinking party
-   先輩のアパートで - at (the action 行う was made possible by) Senpai&rsquo;s apartment
-   行われた - perform/do/conduct (held)

# Lesson 52: In-depth japanese sentence analysis

> 読み会が終了したあと

-   読み会 - Drink party
-   終了 - end; close; termination

> 読み会が終了したあと - After the end of the drinking party

This is a time statement so strictly speaking this should be 「あとに」 but again we can drop the particle.

---

> 彼女はアパートを出てしばらく歩いていた - She left the apartment and walked for a while

---

> ふと先輩の家に携帯電話を忘れてきたことに気付いた - Suddenly, forgetting her phone in senpai&rsquo;s apartment, she realised the thing of - Suddenly she realised that she had forgotten her phone in her senpai&rsquo;s apartment

-   ふと - Suddenly
-   先輩の家に - In senpai&rsquo;s house
-   忘れてきた - 忘れる + 来る - Forget + come - Leaving behind (forgetting to bring (come))
-   先輩の家に携帯電話を忘れてきた - Forgot phone in senpai&rsquo;s house
-   こと - Remember, こと wraps up the clause preceding it and turns it into a noun of &rsquo;the thing of&rsquo;
-   ことに気付いた - Realised that

In 「ことに気付いた」 why is に used and not を? The Japanese-English dictionary translation of 気付く is &rsquo;realise&rsquo;, it *means* much the same, but the *structure* is much different. 気付く is composed of 気 (mind;spirit;feelings) and 付く (adhere;stick), what this literally means is &rsquo;spirit stick&rsquo;, so what we&rsquo;re doing is sticking our spirit (our mind/attention/feelings) to something, so our spirit has become adhered to something. We say this very differently in English, we realise something, i.e. we make a fact real. In Japanese we stick our spirit to a fact. If we stick a poster to a wall, the wall is not the direct object, the poster is, and the wall is the target of the sticking. It is the same here.

---

> 彼女はアパートに引き返し先輩の部屋に戻って呼び鈴を押す

-   引き返し - Particularly in narrative, we can use the い-stem of a verb much the same was as the て-form of a verb, to complete a clause and connect to the next
-   Note again how we are using present-tense sentences in a past-tense story. This is normal for Japanese stories to add immediacy.

---

> ところが反応がない。ドアノブをまわすと鍵はかっていなかったので彼女はそのまま中に入っていた

-   ところが is a common expression in narrative. The が is not the particle but the contrastive conjunction &rsquo;but&rsquo;. ところ which means place can also mean a place in time, so the combined meaning is &rsquo;at that time, then&#x2026;&rsquo;, &rsquo;But then&rsquo;.
-   そのまま - (In) that unchanged state&#x2026; &rsquo;Because the door was unlocked&#x2026;&rsquo; in that (her) unchanged state (just like that) &rsquo;&#x2026; she went in&rsquo;
    -   &rsquo;Because the door was unlocked she went in **just like that**&rsquo;

# Lesson 53: Enjoy Japanese Horror (more sentence analysis)

> 部屋の中は電気がついておらず

-   電気をつける - Turn on the lights
    -   おらず - おる = いる - ず = ない
        -   Both this おる and ず are old fashioned (or けいご (polite) (and sometimes dialectical)) japanese
            -   電気がついておらず - The electricity existed in a state of not having been switched on - The lights were off

---

> どうやら先輩はもう寝てしまたらしい

-   どうやら - It seems/It appears, working in tandem with the らしい at the end of the sentence, somehow &#x2026; it appeared

---

> 無用心だな、と思った彼女は電気をつけて先輩を起こそうかと思ったが、

-   無用心 - Acting without caution esp. w.r.t. crime or danger (examples given include walking down a dark street at night or leaving valuables on display in one&rsquo;s car)
    -   だな - As we know な is the particle used for directing a comment at oneself
-   起こそうかと思った - 起こす (wake, other-move) - 起こそう (volitional form (will to do)) - She thought about possibly waking [senpai]
-   が - but (end of a clause, can&rsquo;t be the other が)

---

> 先輩がかなり酔っていたのを思い出し、そっとしておくことにした。

-   かなり is an adverbial noun (one that doesn&rsquo;t need に or と to modify a verb/adjective) meaning sufficiently/pretty/very
-   の bundles everything that came before it into a noun
    -   思い出し - Remembered, Note: い-stem as a clause-connector
-   そとする means to act quietly, そと (quiet) + する (act (do))
    -   おく means to put something in a place, but as we know the japanese concept of &rsquo;place&rsquo; is very loose, so そとしておく means &rsquo;put in place acting quietly&rsquo; (fairly close to a common English expression)


<a id="orgcd5c7e3"></a>

# Lesson 54: Irregularities in Japanese

This lesson will cover みる みられる みれる みえる and 聞く 聞ける 聞こえる

These are the basic dictionary forms: みる 聞く, The regular potential forms: みられる みれる 聞ける and one alternative/exceptional/irregular potential variant: みえる, 聞こえる

The conventional wisdom is that there are only two irregular verbs, する and くる but there are a few minor irregularities.

Why is みれる not an irregular form when the &rsquo;correct&rsquo; form is みられる? This is a common phenomenon called らぬき where the ら is frequently removed from the ichidan potential helper. This is very common but not official grammar.

What is the difference between the regular and the irregular potential forms? In each of these cases the regular potential form is the &rsquo;force self-move&rsquo; form. The potential form is usually self-move.

> わたしは本が読める - As for me, book readable-does - I can read the book

This is self-move, the book is the actor and it is acting upon itself, making itself readable. We must get used to the fact that Japanese is very happy to treat states of being as verbal actions. We also have:

> わたしは[∅が]読める - As for me, read-can - I can read

It also possible to use the potential in other-move concepts, usually this happens in modifying clauses:

> さくらを見られる日を楽しみにしている - I&rsquo;m looking forward to the day I can see Sakura

「さくらを見られる」 is the modifying clause. Here we can see みられる being used with を, making it an other-move verb, the object being さくら. We can&rsquo;t do this with みえる or きこえる, they are forced to be self-move verbs.

There is a nuance here in that みえる implies literally being &rsquo;able&rsquo; to see something, whereas みられる implies the &rsquo;opportunity&rsquo; to see something. i.e. I have the opportunity to go see a play vs (The lady infront of me has taken off her hat and now) I am able to see the play. The only difference between these two in japanese would be the form of helper verb.

This alone isn&rsquo;t the sole reason for these two forms surviving into modern japanese, the important reason is that the very nature of seeing and hearing, and expressions we use in connection with seeing and hearing are both used in places where in English we would say something looks or sounds like something. You cannot use the regular versions for this, you have to use the irregular.

> さくらはカエルに見える - Sakura looks like a frog

> 奇妙に聞こえる - Sounds peculiar

The way something sounds or looks always has to be self move, because we&rsquo;re not doing anything to the sound or image, it is the sound or image that is doing the act of seeming a certain way.

# Lesson 55: Secrets of the で particle

*Drilling deeper into Japanese structure*

As we know, almost all Japanese words divide into three kinds, nouns, verbs and adjectives, most &rsquo;other types&rsquo; are structurally nouns. There is however another way of dividing words which is used in Japanese grammar, this is to divide them into static &rsquo;body words&rsquo; (体言) and active &rsquo;use-words&rsquo; (用言). Static words essentially boil down to nouns.

By active words, what is meant is those words that can transform, i.e. the final kana can morph or vanish. This applies to both adjectives and verbs. As we know, verbs and adjectives cannot end in a kanji, they must end in a kana. For Godan verbs the final kana is always an う-row kana, and can become the equivalent kana from one of the other 4 rows. For Ichidan verbs the る kana is dropped. For adjectives we can change the い to く、 か or け, or we can drop the い altogether and add something else.

Static words (nouns) on the other hand cannot be modified at all (grammatically), we just add logical particles or the copula to them. It is important to understand that when we join a logical particle and a noun together we must regard those two things as a single unit.

Once we have added the copula (だ) to a noun that unit is not an &rsquo;active&rsquo; word, i.e. we **can** modify it, for instance, as we know, the copula has a て-form which is で, we have modified the final kana of the unit. This is also how we do the past tense of nouns.

This means that all three engines are 用言, active words/units.

Understanding this we can take a deeper look at the particle で.

Unlike what was said when we covered で earlier, で is not absolutely restricted to &rsquo;a does b&rsquo; verb sentences (though most of the time it&rsquo;s used in verb sentences). What で is really restricted to is clauses that modify 用言, and as we have just learned a 用言 can be a verb, can be an adjective, but can also be a noun+copula.

So what is で actually doing?

As we know, there are three &rsquo;positional&rsquo; logical particles, they are:

-   に - Where something goes to or where it is once its got there
-   え - Directional particle
-   で - The boundary or limit within which something happens

Usually the limit described by で is a physical area, though it doesn&rsquo;t have to be. で tells us the boundary within which an action or (here&rsquo;s the new part) a state of being takes place. In other words, it can be adjectival.

> 世界で一番おいしいラメン - The most delicious ramen in the world

Why are using で in this case? 「世界で」 is defining the limit within which something is happening, in this case it&rsquo;s defining the limit within which the state of being applies. We are talking about the most delicious ramen in the world, the limit of the state of being the most delicious ramen is the world.

> この町で一番おいしいラメン - The most delicious ramen in this town

We could say:

> 世界の一番おいしいラメン - The world&rsquo;s most delicious ramen

But this isn&rsquo;t modifying the quality of おいしい (putting a limit on おいしい) in the same way that で is. It is modifying ラメン.

We can also say:

> このラメンは世界で一番おいしい - This ramen is the most delicious in the world

But we can&rsquo;t say:

> このラメンは世界の一番おいしい - This ramen is the most delicious in the world

Because in Japanese words can only modify words that come after them, they can&rsquo;t modify words that come before them, の cannot modify おいしい which is an adjective, it can only modify ラメン which is another noun, and because ラメン  is on the wrong side of it, we can&rsquo;t use it.

Finally, since we now know that a noun+copula functions as a 用言 (an active element) we can also say:

> 世界で一番有名なアンドロイド - The most famous android in the world

世界で couldn&rsquo;t modify 有名 on its own because 有名 is a noun, but joined with な (the connective form of the copula だ) it can.

The same thing is happened when we say:

> みんあで踊る - We all dance

> 二人で踊る - The two of us dance

> 一人で踊る - Dance alone


<a id="orga93d356"></a>

# Lesson 56: Deeper secrets of は and の particles

Japanese is a &rsquo;topic prominent&rsquo; language. Topic-comment structure is a very fundamental aspect of Japanese in a way that it isn&rsquo;t in English. It is for this reason that we so often say &rsquo;as for x&rsquo; when that isn&rsquo;t how we would say something in English.

> アフリカはライオンはいるがトラはいない

In this sentence we have three は s in a very short space. These are **all** topic markers. The first は is the overall topic marker, it&rsquo;s saying &rsquo;speaking of Africa&rsquo;, everything that follows is going to be a comment on the topic of Africa. Everything that follows must be a logical clause, it doesn&rsquo;t matter how small the clause is, but is must be a logical clause. What we have in this example is a sentence consisting of two logical clauses, each of which contains a &rsquo;sub-topic&rsquo;. Each logical clause also has a topic statement preceding it. In full:

> アフリカはライオンは[∅が]いるがトラは[∅が]いない

Note how there is the contrastive conjunction は used in this sentence. You can tell that it is this が and not the other because it follows a verb (いる) and the logical particle が can only mark nouns.

Why are they doing this?

It is because は is used to distinguish things.

> アフリカはライオンはいるがトラはいない - Speaking of Africa, speaking of lions, they exist but speaking of tigers, they don&rsquo;t exist.

We would never say something like this in English, because the topic marker は is very *agile*, but the methods of introducing a topic in English are not, so they seem forceful or cumbersome.

When we introduce something using は we are implicitly saying that the comment on the new topic is different from the comment on the old topic. If we wanted to say that the comment is the same we would use the topic marker も.

---

A similar example with の that isn&rsquo;t structurally very complicated, but is very unlike what would be said in English. This comes from the song &rsquo;the bells of notre dame&rsquo;:

> 朝のパリに響くのは鐘だよ

Where are the A and the B of this sentence? This is an A is B sentence. The は-marked topic is 「朝のパリに響くの」 so の is bundling 「朝のパリに響く」 into a single noun which we&rsquo;re talking about, &rsquo;Resounds in morning paris&rsquo; -> &rsquo;That which resounds in morning Paris&rsquo;. The A or が marked topic is that which has just been defined for us by の (the resounding thing in a parisian morning).

Why is it being put this way? Because it *can* be. Again, it is cumbersome in English, but not in Japanese.


<a id="org200d0e6"></a>

# Lesson 57: 込む - The secret of multi-meaning Japanese words

Often in japanese-english dictionaries there words that seem to have a whole range of different and ostensibly unconnected meanings. Not homophones, where the kanji are different but the sound is the same, these are multiple meanings all for the same exact word. The important thing to understand is that normally there&rsquo;s going to be a &rsquo;base&rsquo; concrete meaning, and from that a number of metaphorical meanings.

Human language whenever it discusses in abstract uses words that are based in concrete physical metaphors, even if we forget that they are metaphors. i.e. we talk about time in terms of space, going forwards and backwards, and existing on a line. This is true for all abstractions. When we come across words in Japanese that seem to have disparate meanings we need to understand the basic metaphor in use.

One of these words is the word 込む (こむ). 込む does not have an exact meaning in English, but we can see what it does mean by looking at the kanji. The kanji is essentially the kanji of 入 from 入る (enter/put in) and the free radical meaning &rsquo;road&rsquo;, some say it looks like a waterslide, Cure Dolly says a fast road. This is the meaning of 込む to cram in in large quantities, put in rapidly, put in vigorously.

We may encounter this initially in very simple meanings such as &rsquo;込んでいる&rsquo; - the state of being 込む i.e. crowded. It can have more abstract meanings like &rsquo;complicated&rsquo; which is essentially the same, a lot of ideas/concepts all crammed in.

It then becomes attached as a helper verb to the い-stem of other verbs. 飛び込む which means &rsquo;jump in&rsquo;. Either literally or metaphorically.


<a id="orgcba2966"></a>

# Lesson 58: Particle combinations

There&rsquo;s really no such thing as double particles or particle combinations as such, the particles are really just doing what they do all the time.

It is important to remember the distinction between logical and non-logical particles.

You can&rsquo;t combine any of the logical particles with any of the others, because logical particles mark nouns with their function in the sentence. What you can combine them with is the non-logical particles, notably the two non-logical topic markers は and も. Combining in this way doesn&rsquo;t clash at all logically as は and も don&rsquo;t tell us anything about what a noun is doing in the sentence.

The two primary logical particles が and を don&rsquo;t combine with the non-logical particles because any sentence that is directly transitive, that is a sentence where the actor acts upon an object directly. &rsquo;I eat&rsquo; for example is intransitive, but &rsquo;I eat bread&rsquo; is intransitive.

Any sentence with the を particle is directly transitive, the use of any other particle i.e. と or に is indirectly transitive.

Because of the directness of が (the thing acting) and を (the thing being acted upon) they can&rsquo;t have a non-logical particle appended to them. If you wanted to attach a non-logical particle you would simply leave the logical particle out, and because が and を are so fundamental they would be understood by the hearer in Japanese.

We can pair the remaining logical particles with any non-logical particle, the reason for which isn&rsquo;t to make any kind of unusual pair-combination, but to simply use the functions of both particles at the same time.

> ∅が冬には雪だるまを作る - As for in the winter, we make snowman

We don&rsquo;t need this は, but we can choose to use it to make &rsquo;in winter&rsquo; the subject of the sentence. は also differentiates winter from the other seasons, implying we only make snowmen then.

> ∅が春にも雪だるまを作る - We make a snowman in the spring as well

We do need に so that the topic is about **in** winter.

> 学校には行く - Going to school

This sentence carries the implication that we&rsquo;re going to school but not going somewhere else (because of the exclusiveness of the は particle).


<a id="org2a7c1ff"></a>

# Lesson 59: Untranslatable Japanese

There is a group of verbs in Japanese that are defined by their English translations, but the definition isn&rsquo;t real. These are the &rsquo;become&rsquo; verbs:

-   濡れる - Do (state of) wet (become wet)
-   濁る - Do (state of) cloudy/muddy (become cloudy/muddy)


<a id="org765cde8"></a>

# Lesson 60: Non-logical structure

Japanese is very topic-comment focused.

Just as with が, every sentence also has a は marked topic, whether we can see it or not

-   アメリカ人です
-   ∅がアメリカ人です
-   ∅は∅がアメリカ人です
-   (I) am the topic, (I) am the subject, and (I) am an American

Just as a sentence isn&rsquo;t *logically complete* without a が-marked subject (invisible or otherwise) a sentence isn&rsquo;t *grammatically complete* without a は-marked topic (invisible or otherwise).

As with が the default value of ∅ is &rsquo;I&rsquo;.

The topic is usually a noun, and the comment must be a complete logical clause.


<a id="orga272df4"></a>

# Lesson 61: が and は deeper secrets

Topic-comment structure is fundamental to Japanese. Every sentence has a topic marked by は, and a comment consisting of a complete logical clause, a が marked subject and some engine. Both the topic and the subject can be invisible.

In sentences where both the topic and the subject are the same thing, we can use one or both particles. Choice of particle depends on whether we want to emphasise that the thing at hand is the subject or the topic. For instance, if the person we are speaking to isn&rsquo;t aware of who/what something is, it is bast to introduce that thing with が first to explain what it is/does.

A topic marker can only mark **old** information. This is important because old-information is unimportant information. New information is the thing we&rsquo;re actually trying to convey to someone. は therefore cannot mark new information.

There is an example here (in English) about &rsquo;I fed the iguana&rsquo;, if we used は people would ask &rsquo;what iguana&rsquo; because you hadn&rsquo;t mentioned it yet. The same is true in English, you would have to say &rsquo;I fed my&rsquo; or &rsquo;I fed an&rsquo;. Keep in mind, there are limits to this. For instance, in English it&rsquo;s very common to say &rsquo;I fed the dog&rsquo;, to someone, even if they don&rsquo;t know you have a dog, because it&rsquo;s very normal to own a dog, less so to own an Iguana.

> 本を買った - (I) bought a book

This is the most normal way to say &rsquo;I bought a book&rsquo;. As we know the ∅ defaults to &rsquo;I&rsquo; when the context isn&rsquo;t telling us that it&rsquo;s anything else. There is no emphasis, it is just a mutual &rsquo;I bought a book&rsquo;. In this sentence I is the subject and the topic.

> 私は本を買った - What I did was buy a book (you might have bought something else or nothing at all, but *I* bought a book)

If we choose to stress &rsquo;I&rsquo; as the topic we are making わたし into the old information, and the buying of the book into the new information. は has a distinguishing function. When we use は we are either establishing or changing the topic. We know は not only changes the topic to whatever it marks, but it also implies that the comment on the new topic is different to the comment on the old topic. Even if there wasn&rsquo;t an old topic it still implies that the comment is different than the comment on other possible topics. This means that the sentence is implicitly an answer to the question (even if it wasn&rsquo;t asked) &rsquo;what did you do?&rsquo;.

> 私が本を買った - It is I who bought the book

Here we have reversed the emphasis. The old information is now the buying of the book and the new information is *I*. Why would we say this? Perhaps someone is looking at an empty space in the bookshelf and wondering what happened. Then we would place the emphasis on it being &rsquo;I&rsquo; who removed the book (by buying it). The book being gone (i.e. bought) is known information by both parties here, even if the exact reason for the books disappearance isn&rsquo;t known. Though, if you&rsquo;re in a bookstore the most likely reason is that it was bought.

は and が can also mark particularities, as well as generalities:

> 花はきれいだ - More likely to mean flowers in general

Flowers are old information, we all know what flowers are, so flowers in general.

> 花がきれいだ - More likely to mean these particular flowers

Flowers are new information, so it must be some non-general flowers.

These are all tendencies however. There is no structural reason for any of these differences. They come entirely from expectations.

は also adds emphasis forwards:

> おまえみたいな半人前に休みはない - For trainees like you, there are no rests - (More accurately) As for traineers like you, as for rests, there are none

The topic is 「おまえみたいな半人前に」 but the writer has chosen to deemphasise this topic, and introduce a subtopic that is やすみ, &rsquo;rests&rsquo;. This places the emphases on the not existing of the tests.

# Lesson 62: て-おく vs て-しまう, Helper verb secrets

Japanese people are very fond of helper verbs and attach them very often depending on circumstance. We do the same thing in English, but not with verbs, with prepositions. Particularly with &rsquo;up&rsquo; and &rsquo;out&rsquo;:

-   Make up - Make out
-   Speak up - Speak out
-   Throw up - Throw out
-   Eat up - Eat out
-   Wake up
-   Try out
    
    Japanese doesn&rsquo;t have any prepositions, but uses helper verbs in place of them.
    
    Remember, おく means &rsquo;place/put&rsquo; and ておく means to put something in place (for some reason). That is to say, the use of ておく implies a reason for the action, even if not stated.


<a id="org7d9a5ae"></a>

# Lesson 63: Sentence enders in real life Japanese


<a id="orgfa32605"></a>

## かい

かい is simply a softened and colloquial form of か. In casual speech we don&rsquo;t use か as a sentence-ender question marker very often (though we do use it in other positions). Usually we will just use a rising intonation (or a question mark on its own in typed speech), we may use の (which is ambiguous because it can mark a question or an explanation), but we can occasionally use かい. かい is a predominantly masculine (though older women may use it) and rather &rsquo;folksy&rsquo; way of marking a question.


<a id="orgf431296"></a>

## だい

だい is just だ+かい. This is the form of かい we use in copula-ending sentences. Everything about かい applies to だい except a particularly common colloquialism which is 「どうだい」 meaning &rsquo;how is [something]&rsquo;.


<a id="org2590cd4"></a>

## ちょうだい

This isn&rsquo;t related to かい or だい but is an informal equivalent to ください, so usually it is added to the て-form of a verb to ask someone to do something. It is slightly feminine but not exclusively.


<a id="org334022d"></a>

## Emphasisers

-   せ - verbal exclamation mark that adds force - masculine - far more common in anime and manga than in real life
-   そ - verbal exclamation mark that adds force - masculine - far more common in anime and manga than in real life
-   さ - more common verbal exclamation mark, slightly masculine but not exclusively. Very likely to hear in real life


<a id="orge316be9"></a>

## pseudo-sentence enders

Often sentences end in conjunctions. This has been covered previously.

し is very similar to から, it&rsquo;s most common and regular use is to combine reasons. There is an example here, it essentiall goes: reason a し reason b し therefore&#x2026; you can therefore use し with only one reason to imply that there are other reasons also. し has the effect of softening a reason, so saying something like &rsquo;because riding a bike is forbidden here&rsquo; + し sounds a bit friendlier. This tactic of &rsquo;vaguing&rsquo; things up is common in English using words like &rsquo;like&rsquo; and &rsquo;kinda&rsquo;


<a id="orgac589c3"></a>

# Lesson 64: もの and こと secrets

When first introduced もの and こと where explained as being for tangible, and abstract things separately. This is a good explanation for an early learner, but is not the whole picture:

> 愛はすばらしいいものだ - Love is a wonderful thing

Obviously love is abstract, so why are we using もの? もの is used for *nouns*. A noun representing a physical thing or a noun representing an abstract thing.

> 日本に行ったことがある - (I) have been to Japan

Notice how this is a very different statement to &rsquo;I went to Japan&rsquo;. &rsquo;I went&rsquo; speaks of one particular instance, whereas &rsquo;I have&rsquo; could mean once, or many times. It is the general fact of having been. &rsquo;(As for me) the thing (the activity/the fact) of &rsquo;went to Japan&rsquo; exists&rsquo;.

> 日本に行くことがある - The fact of my **going** to Japan exists - I sometimes go to Japan

> どんな人にも失敗することがある - Everybody sometimes makes mistakes - Whatever kind of person it may be, the fact of making mistakes exists.


<a id="org6cd8695"></a>

## もの as a sentence ender

Sometimes もの is used in a way that looks like a sentence-ender. The first way is when ものだ is added to a complete logical clause. What this means, is that, the logical clause that we&rsquo;re speaking about, as a generalisation, is reality (is a thing).

> 冬は寒いものだ - Winter is cold, and that&rsquo;s just a thing (fact)

> 子供のころには、よくこちらに来たものだ - When I was a child, coming here was a thing.

Note that such a statement has a nostalgic ring to it, and a sense of personalness. As well as an implicit statement that we no longer come.

What is the difference between:

> 日本に行ったことがある - (I) have been to Japan

> 日本に行ったものだ - (I) used to go to Japan

Note the latter is far more emotional.


<a id="org668b9d0"></a>

## こと as a sentence ender

こと is used as a sentence ender for lists of rules. Even a single statement, if followed by こと shows that that thing is a rule/regulation. こと shows that the statement is a decision that has been made. Refer to lessons 28 and 29.


<a id="org5ed48fb"></a>

# Lesson 65: て行く and て来る, coming and going

There are some notes here on the differences between kuru and iku and their English translations of come and go
Essentially Kuru just means movement from somewhere else to where I am, Iku on the other hand is not quite so strict
There are also some examples of Iku being used as a time metaphor

> 勉強すれば、だんだん数学が分かってくる - If you study, you will come to understand mathematics

(Noting the above comments) It is not possible to use くる to speak about &rsquo;coming&rsquo; to somewhere you aren&rsquo;t currently. You can only &rsquo;go&rsquo; to somewhere you aren&rsquo;t currently. So what&rsquo;s going on? This is because 分かる does not mean &rsquo;understand&rsquo;, it means &rsquo;understandable&rsquo;, so what we&rsquo;re really saying is that the understanding will come to us (from away from us).

いく represents either movement away from us, or from one spot to another that doesn&rsquo;t involve us. This applies also to metaphors. くる can only mean towards us, or involving/relating to us, physically, temporally, or emotionally.

> 寒くなってきた - It became cold to me/us (directly involves us)

> 寒くなっていった - It became cold (objectively speaking)


<a id="org10cdb6a"></a>

# Lesson 66: Hidden subjects

Sometimes Japanese may not define the ∅ pronoun. We do this sometimes in English too: &rsquo;I hear they&rsquo;re putting a man on mars next year&rsquo;. Who&rsquo;s &rsquo;they&rsquo;, we can&rsquo;t tell from the sentence, we just have to use our wider knowledge to conclude NASA (or Mr. Musk, Russians or the ESA or the Chinese). This is quite common in Japanese.


<a id="orgd1e6163"></a>

# Lesson 67: もう and まだ

まだ situates the present time inside a time segment that stretches back into the past and is either expected to end, or at the last the possibility of its ending is being considered. There was some expected point at which the time segment would end, however this is not when it ended, it has extended beyond this point into the present, and is now expected to actually end in the future. This essentially means &rsquo;still&rsquo;.

> 宿題は​**まだ**​しなかった - I haven&rsquo;t done my homework yet/I still haven&rsquo;t done my homework - The time segment of me not having done my homework is still ongoing, it should&rsquo;ve finished (I should&rsquo;ve done my homework already), but it will end (I will do my homework (or at least it&rsquo;s possible that I&rsquo;ll do it))

> さくらはまだ若い - Sakura is still young

> さくらはまだ大人ではない - Sakura is not yet grown up - Sakura is still not an adult

Note: negatives do not have to be explicit:

> 1.  日本語はうまいね - Your Japanese is very good isn&rsquo;t it
> 2.  いえまだまだです - Not yet i.e. We&rsquo;re still in the time period where our Japanese isn&rsquo;t good

With もう the dictionary definitions get more confusing, but really it&rsquo;s no different to まだ, only in reverse. Instead of a time segment that should&rsquo;ve ended in the past extending into the future, we have a time segment that should&rsquo;ve started in the future, but actually started in the past (and is still ongoing). The best translation into English would be &rsquo;already&rsquo;.

> **もう**​やったよ - I&rsquo;ve already done it

There are some notes here on how もう (and まだ) means &rsquo;now&rsquo; but how also &rsquo;already&rsquo; in English means now, it&rsquo;s just down to how different languages prefer to use different words

> **もう**​大丈夫 - I&rsquo;m fine now (I&rsquo;m already fine)

Just note how these are essentially the same statement, just noone would say &rsquo;I&rsquo;m already fine&rsquo; in English.

もう is also used as an expression of annoyance:

> **もう**​いい - Enough already

> **もう**​やめた - Stop that now (not later (it should&rsquo;ve never started))

> **もう**​&#x2026;! - Sheesh

There is actually a second (albeit similar) もう. It is related the particle も and has the same additive meaning.

> **もう**​一つ - Another thing

もう (proper もう) is a time relation that means &rsquo;already&rsquo;, dictionaries also say that it means &rsquo;soon&rsquo;. It only means soon in certain combinations:

> **もう**​すぐ - Soon

This is a sort of double positive, すぐ by itself means soon, and もう means already, so we have &rsquo;already soon&rsquo;. もう is emphasising the &rsquo;soon&rsquo;. &rsquo;It is soon right now&rsquo;.

> **もう**​少し - (just) a little more - Already a little (We&rsquo;ve come all this way and there&rsquo;s only a little bit left (time/effort/distance))

The additive もう is also often used to express time relations in much the same way as the regular もう.

> \*もう\*二度来ないよ! - I&rsquo;ll never come again - lit: I won&rsquo;t come for another second time


<a id="orgb7d7d59"></a>

# Lesson 68: Japanese underlying logic, わけ、 そういうわけ、 わけが分からない、 わけない

わけ is another word that is used in a variety of ways and situations in Japanese and that English dictionaries give a myriad of definitions for that seem very disjointed.

わけ is a noun that&rsquo;s *original* root meaning meant &rsquo;divide&rsquo; or &rsquo;separate&rsquo; as in わける and is also related to わかる (do understandable (understand)). The metaphor here is to break something down into constituent parts, this applies simply to &rsquo;divide&rsquo; and also to &rsquo;understand&rsquo; as &rsquo;do broken-down&rsquo;.

Of note: わけ is not tied to any one kanji, it is a fundamental Japanese word that predates kanji. There are in fact three kanji that can represent わけ (although it is usually written in kana) and each carries a different nuance to the same fundamental meaning.

わけ means &rsquo;cause&rsquo; or &rsquo;conclusion&rsquo;. A cause and a conclusion are essentially the same thing, they just work in opposite directions. One reasons forwards, one reasons backwards.

1.  わけ is used to give a reason:

> そういう​**わけ**​でベッドの下に隠れた - By so-said reasoning I hid under the bed - For that reason I hid under the bed

> そういう​**わけ**​でした - Thus-said reasoning was - So that&rsquo;s how it happened

> そんな​**わけ**​で宿題を忘れました

1.  わけは分からない

> わけは分からない - The reason doesn&rsquo;t do understandable - It doesn&rsquo;t make sense

1.  わけではない - わけ used as &rsquo;it&rsquo;s not as if&#x2026;&rsquo; &rsquo;it doesn&rsquo;t mean that&#x2026;&rsquo;

> 1.  She always eats in cheap restaurants
> 2.  お金が足りない​**わけ**​ではない - Money-is-insufficient reasoning is not - The conclusion isn&rsquo;t that she&rsquo;s low on money - It&rsquo;s not as if she doesn&rsquo;t have the money

-   Remember any clause can modify a noun (the noun here is わけ)

> 嫉妬した​**わけ**​ではありません - It&rsquo;s not that I got jealous

1.  わけがない/わけない - Strong denial
2.  Y=X わけではない - Proposition Y does not have the *reasoning* of entailing proposition X - The circumstance we&rsquo;re talking about doesn&rsquo;t have **that** reason (for it to be)
3.  X わけがない - Proposition X does not have any reasoning (therefore it&rsquo;s not true) - **No** reasoning exists for that

> さくらはうそをつく​**わけ**​がない - Sakura-tell-a-lie reasoning is non-existent - The reason for Sakura to lie doesn&rsquo;t exist - Sakura would never lie

Note, just because we can see *reasons*, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that those reasons are actually enough for someone to do something based on their character.

> さくらを忘れる​**わけ**​がない - I won&rsquo;t forget (you) Sakura

1.  わけがない - (Simply) there&rsquo;s no reason

> そんなにお金のいる​**わけ**​がない - So-much-money needed reasoning is non-existent - There&rsquo;s no reason to have so much money - There&rsquo;s no need to have so much money

1.  わけがない - Something is simple/easy (hyperbole)

X has no reasoning (therefore is simple enough to exist without it (hyperbole))

> 日本語をはなすのわわけがないことだ - Speaking Japanese is easy (and there&rsquo;s no reason needed) - Japanese is a no-brainer


<a id="orge3e56eb"></a>

# Lesson 69: Kaidan 4

のだ sentence ender means something like &rsquo;it was that [whatever came before]&rsquo;. Same for んです.

おる is an old-fashioned/literary version of いる.

い-stem of a verb is a more literary way of joining two clauses.

見て欲しい means &rsquo;want someone to see&rsquo;.


<a id="orgb55c4ee"></a>

# Lesson 70: かける/かかる

The core meaning of these two words is &rsquo;hang&rsquo; or &rsquo;hook&rsquo;, though as has been covered previously the Japanese definition doesn&rsquo;t quite occupy the same meaning-space as the English. The two versions are just for self-move (かかる) and other-move (かける) usages.


<a id="org5dd1024"></a>

## かける

Again, かける doesn&rsquo;t quite mean &rsquo;hang&rsquo;/&rsquo;hook&rsquo;. When we cover something with a blanket we use かける:

> 毛布をかける - Put a blanket over [it]

In Japanese we don&rsquo;t &rsquo;put&rsquo; as we would a cup on a table, we &rsquo;put&rsquo; in such a way that it hangs down the sides.

> メガネをかける - Put on glasses

Again, in English we would us &rsquo;put&rsquo; here, but in Japanese they are &rsquo;hanging&rsquo; from our ears and nose. Similarly a necklace would &rsquo;hang&rsquo; from our neck (this is more similar to English).

Also, when we shake something over food (say sugar or flour) we use (振り)かける. Again, this is because the ingredient covers and in a manner hangs from. It&rsquo;s not one solid sheet, it&rsquo;s a collection of particles, but the behaviour of covering and going over the sides is the same.

As we&rsquo;re talking about things being in a sense stuck/caught on something (a necklace is hanging from a neck but it&rsquo;s also caught there and can&rsquo;t easily get away) this notion of putting something onto something in a way that it doesn&rsquo;t easily become dislodged can apply to putting an effect (magic spell, aesthetic, nuisance/annoyance etc) on someone:

> 魔法をかける - Put a magic (spell) [on&#x2026;]

> 腰をかける - Hips hanging - Sat down

> かぎをかける - Hang a lock - Lock the door (かぎ means both key and lock in Japanese)

> はなしをかける - Hook-up a conversation - Start a conversation

かけた can be used to actions which haven&rsquo;t completed (have gotten caught):

> 食べかけた Cookie - Part eaten cookie - A cookie that got caught on eating


<a id="org5a81534"></a>

## かかる

As we&rsquo;re talking about things being in a sense stuck/caught on something (a necklace is hanging from a neck but it&rsquo;s also caught there and can&rsquo;t easily get away) the self-move version especially can have a meaning of &rsquo;caught in a trap&rsquo;:

> 詐欺にかかっている - Caught in (by) a swindle

Something rather untranslatable:

> 時間がかかる - Time hangs - Take time

> 日本語を覚えるのに時間がかかる - Time is caught in the act of learning Japanese - Leaning Japanese hangs on time - Learning Japanese takes time

> お金がかかる - Money hangs - Take money

> 電話をかける - Hang a telephone - Hookup a phone call - Make a telephone call

> 電話かかかる - The telephone hangs itself - Telephone got hooked up - Receive a telephone call


<a id="orgc83ef42"></a>

# Lesson 71: Japanese counters

There are a lot of Japanese counters. Often we can avoid using them however by just using the native Japanese counting system of ひとつ、 ふたつ、 みっつ etc (for everything but people/animals).

We don&rsquo;t really need to learn counters in order to understand what someone is saying. This is because counters come in the pattern of number-counter-thing. So if we hear いちりんのはな we can clearly see they mean &rsquo;one flower&rsquo;.

There are two ways of using counters. One is the standard that we might expect of English &rsquo;five-head of cattle&rsquo;. The confusing one is something like:

> ねこが 3 びきいる - Cats three-ly exist - There are three cats.

What kind of word is ひき? ひき is just a noun. Counters act as adverbial nouns that modify the verb (See lesson 41).

> 写真をさんまい撮った - I took photographs threely lit. three-flat-things-ly

---

We can just learn counters as we go, but what about the sound changes? Let&rsquo;s look at ひき, the counter for small animals:

1.  いっぴき
2.  にひき
3.  さんびき
4.  よんひき
5.  ごひき
6.  ろっぴき
7.  ななひき
8.  はっぴき
9.  きゅうひき
10. じゅっぴき

Rule 1. If the first kana of the counter can&rsquo;t take a ten-ten, then there will never be any sounds changes.

Rule 2. All ten-tenable kana counters replace the second syllable of the number with small つ:

-   いちかい -> いっかい
-   いちさい -> いっさい
-   いちひき -> いっぴき

Rule 3. Sometimes a ten-ten or maru is added to the counter, often this is optional


<a id="org3b60207"></a>

# Lesson 72: The great connector (い-stem)

The japanese name for the い-stem of verbs is the 連用形 (れんようけい) connective-use form. Sometimes in English it is referred to as the masu-stem which isn&rsquo;t wholly inaccurate as it is used in です/ます form, but also a great many other things too.

A small note: The い-stem connects verbs to dedicated helpers and non-dedicated helpers, whereas the て-form only connects verbs to non-dedicated helpers, other verbs that exist in their own right to form a new verb. The い-stem can join verbs to nouns to form new nouns, but the て-form cannot do this.

Just as the て-form can cannot two logical clauses into a compound sentence, the い-stem can do the same thing:

> お店に行ってパンを買った

> お店に行きパンを買った

There is one extra thing that the い-stem can do that the other stems, and the て form cannot do, which is *Nominalisation* (in the same vein as の and こと), that is to say, the い-stem is the true &rsquo;noun-form&rsquo; of verbs. の and こと and etc. don&rsquo;t turn a verb into a noun, they turn the entire clause (of which the verb is the engine) and turn that clause into a noun.

In English the verb form and the noun form of a verb are usually (though not always) the same, this is not the case in Japanese as above.

-   verb - 休む - rest - I need **to** rest
-   noun - 休み - rest - I need **a** rest

> お店に[1]パンを買いに[2]行く - Going to the shops to buy bread

[1] marks location target noun, [2] marks purpose target noun. Note how &rsquo;buy bread&rsquo; is a noun (it has to be to be marked by に).


<a id="orgdcf8d42"></a>

# Lesson 73: 気 Ki

気 is the fundamental spirit or fluid energy of a person or something else.

Japanese use 気をけて (attach your spirit) in the same way in English we say &rsquo;mind&#x2026;&rsquo; i.e. mind the step, be careful of the step, attach your spirit to the step.


<a id="orgeba873c"></a>

## 気になる 気にする

Something becomes our spirit. In Japanese we *become* an emotion, this isn&rsquo;t the case for English.

> あの人は気になる - That person turns into my spirit - That person is occupying my feelings (concern/intrigue/love/etc.)

Neither 気になる 気にする mean anything on their own.

> あの人を気にする - I am turning that person into my spirit - I am being concerned about that person

Now the doer of the action is I. There are two implications here, the first is that we are the one controlling our spirit, it isn&rsquo;t acting naturally. This gives it a slightly more negative meaning. It typically therefore means worried. The other implication is that we are in control of our spirit. 気にしないで - Don&rsquo;t turn it into your spirit - Don&rsquo;t worry about it.


<a id="org00838f1"></a>

## 気がする

Here it is the spirit itself that&rsquo;s acting. Our spirit, or a certain aspect of it is acting. Remember that in Japanese things can &rsquo;do&rsquo; themselves i.e. いい匂いがする - A good smell is doing (smells (there is))

> 騙されているような気がする - I&rsquo;ve got a feeling we&rsquo;re being tricked/deceived. - A deceiving-appearance-feeling is active (doing itself i.e. existing and)


<a id="orgf8a6c58"></a>

## 気に入る

> これを気に入る - I&rsquo;m letting this into my soul

Of note, when describing what someone else likes, this pattern is much more polite than tai/garu/hoshii.


<a id="orgbf669a8"></a>

# Lesson 74: Love and other mysteries of こと

> あなたのことが好きだ - I like your thing(s) - I like thing(s) about you - I love you

こと is a very agile word in Japanese.

> 私のことが嫌いらしい - My koto (conduct/appearance/words (aspects of us)) seems dislikeable (to them)

When there isn&rsquo;t a cultural factor こと can be much easier to understand.

> 田中(たなか)さんのことはね。。。 - The affair concerning Tanaka-san (what we actually mean depends on what the hearer knows about ourselves and tanaka)

言う and こと in a way belong together, because a koto is a situation or circumstance, that by implication requires a bit of explanation. So the idea of an explanation and the idea of a koto have always been very close in Japanese. (There are some notes on Kanji here).

> どう言うこと!？ - What sort of koto?

You will likely see this phrase say, in an anime when someone is teleported to a new location. &rsquo;どう言うこと!？&rsquo; - What kind of place is this? - Explain what situation is going on here.

> そう言うことでした - So that&rsquo;s how the situation was explained - I&rsquo;ve solved it

Note: The explanation already exists, it&rsquo;s just that we&rsquo;ve now discovered it, hence past tense.

> いいえ、そんあこと。。。 - That&rsquo;s not true (politely refusing praise)
> そんあこと! - That thing (negative reaction)
> そんな! - That [thing] (protest)


<a id="org5d926ae"></a>

# Lesson 75: How expression strategies differ

1.  Japanese doesn&rsquo;t have pronouns, わたし and ぼく are just nouns like any other. There is also no equivalent to &rsquo;it&rsquo;. The usual way to say &rsquo;I&rsquo; is ∅, the usual way to say &rsquo;you&rsquo; is ∅, the usual way to say &rsquo;it&rsquo; is ∅.

2.  かれ (he) and かのじょ (she) were originally introduced for translating western novels. They are used in regular Japanese, but not nearly as often as just ∅

How would we say &rsquo;Sakura and **her** dog&rsquo;? We could say:

> さくらと彼女の犬

But the usual way would be:

> さくらとその犬

We are taught early on that その means &rsquo;that&rsquo;, which it does, but as we know Japanese words don&rsquo;t exactly correspond to their English &rsquo;equivalents&rsquo;. In Japanese &rsquo;that&rsquo; goes further to include relations. さくらとその犬 - Sakura and a dog relating to her - Sakura and her dog. This can also be used for &rsquo;that place&rsquo;, as in, the place that would relate to whatever action we&rsquo;re talking about (without explicitly mentioning it).

---

> ある日のこと - The affair (story) of a certain day

> ある村のこと - The affair of a certain village


<a id="orga444b2f"></a>

# Lesson 76: Aku, akeru, hiraku, hirakeru

開く and 開ける demonstrate some of the subtleties of self/other verbs in Japanese.

In practice in Japanese we will hear things that are technically incorrect:

> 目を開く - Open one&rsquo;s eyes (eyes open themselves)

What is the difference between あく and ひらく (they use the same kanji+kana spelling). あく is self-move, ひらく is both self-move and other-move. The difference between them is not about self-move vs. other-move, it&rsquo;s to do with the *kind* of opening that is being talked about. Opening bottles, taking lids off of boxes etc is definitely あける, if we talk about a flower opening it&rsquo;s definitely ひらく. That is, anything that unfurls, unfolds or opens outwards is ひらく, anything that simple &rsquo;opens&rsquo; is あく. There are cases where the two words are interchangeable, but even in these cases the choice of あく/ひらく stresses the kind of opening going on i.e. French doors.

ひらける is a state of being, the state of being open, with the implication that this state will continue

> 運がひらける - Luck opens (and will stay that way)


<a id="org346d1cf"></a>

# Lesson 77: Real Japanese structure vs Tae Kim

There are no notes today


<a id="org01ff5d0"></a>

# Lesson 78: Tae Kim vs the Copula

Likely to not have any notes to take again. There is a brief note here further explaining the lack of Japanese verb &ldquo;conjugations&rdquo;, in that a conjugated verb is still a verb, but Japanese verbs are transformed into (not conjugated into) verbs, and adjectives. たべない is not a conjugated verb, it&rsquo;s an adjective.


<a id="org74d4382"></a>

# Lesson 79: Deeper secrets of the copula

English doesn&rsquo;t have a dedicated copula. Every language has a copula, it is the one-way equals sign that tells us A is B, but B is not necessarily A. To go a bit deeper, what the copula does is place things into sets. A belongs to the set of things B. The set may only be a set of one, i.e. That person is Sakura, then &rsquo;that person&rsquo; (and that person only) is Sakura. English doesn&rsquo;t have a dedicated copula, English doubles up the verb of being (is, be, am, are, was, were, etc.) with the copula. These two completely different semantic functions are so closely packed that natives can&rsquo;t even tell them apart. This causes no issue for native speakers, but it does make it difficult for native English speakers to learn languages that do have a dedicated copula.


<a id="org9b3540d"></a>

# Lesson 80: Dropped particles and casual omissions

There are fundamentally two different kinds of omission in language. Legal omission and illegal omission. Legal omission is perfectly grammatical. This happens in English: &rsquo;the night [that] we met&rsquo;. It is not ungrammatical to do this. This happens in Japanese with the ∅ pronoun. This is perfectly grammatical Japanese. In the case of a simple statement like &rsquo;つかれた&rsquo;, since in Japanese we aren&rsquo;t allowed to talk about how someone else is, only how they appear, we know that this must mean &rsquo;∅がつかれた&rsquo;. This is a perfectly grammatical (legal) omission (at least in casual speech).

There are three kinds of illegal omission.

The first is leaving out bits of words or phrases, these range from *accepted* (won&rsquo;t, shouldn&rsquo;t) to *slangy* (wanna, gonna) to *very slangy* (shmup):

-   している -> してる (accepted)
-   つまらない -> つまんない (slangy)
-   そんな -> んな (very slangy)

Secondly, single-kana elements that attach to nouns (particles, だ) can get dropped where they are obvious from the logic of the sentence. Again, in casual but not formal speech:

> わたし、アンドロイド = わたしはアンドロイドだ

At the casual level, since だ can always be dropped, (sometimes, depending on the person and how they use だ) the use of だ explicitly can be seen as an emphasis marker.

Finally, the third kind of thing that gets dropped are &rsquo;trailing&rsquo; sentences that imply, but do not state a second clause. These are relatively rare in English but common in Japanese:

-   Let&rsquo;s do it and&#x2026;
-   It&rsquo;s rather big, therefore&#x2026;
-   I&rsquo;d like some but&#x2026;
-   Afraid I can&rsquo;t because&#x2026;
-   If we don&rsquo;t hurry&#x2026;
-   You&rsquo;d better do it or else&#x2026;

In Japanese this often takes the form of ending a sentence with the て form. This has been discussed before, but can be used to soften or strengthen a statement.

# Lesson 81: Global principle of all Japanese word forms

We&rsquo;ve already covered the Japanese stem system. Verbs simply make a small change to the final kana, from the う-row to another row, to which we then attach helper verbs and adjectives. The stem system goes much further than this. We already know about the て-form, but there&rsquo;s far more to it than just this.

There are two kinds of words in Japanese. These are inert (unchangeable) words. These are in 99% of cases nouns, and in the remaining few cases things such as conjunctions. Then there are active (changeable) words. These cover the three engine-words, verbs, adjectives, and the copula.

All of the words that can change, change in the exact same way. The only thing that changes in these words is the final kana. Nothing before that last kana can change, the rest of the word is as inert as a noun. They all change according to the stem-helper system. All the て-form was introduced as a &rsquo;form&rsquo;, it is infact a stem-helper system of its own. In real Japanese grammar as taught to natives た and て are regarded as helpers that attach to the stem of a word. In this way verbs have two stem-systems.

What about adjectives? Adjectives have their own stem system. Adjectives have four stems, you can form the adjective stems by dropping the い, and attaching く, かっ, けれ and ∅ (dropping the い entirely as with ichidan verbs).

The く-stem attaches the ない helper adjective, stands on its own as an adverb, and attaches て to form the て-form.

The かっ-stem attaches the past-helper た. (たら and たり are listed here also but no explanation is given).

The けれ-stem attaches the helper-conditional ば.

When we drop the い altogether we can attach the そう helper &rsquo;seems&rsquo;, as well as helper verbs like がる and すぎる.

The copula has a mini-stem system, becoming で (て-form) and な (connective-form). (There&rsquo;s again some notes here on だっ and だろ and how the final kana in these instances are morphed but it&rsquo;s a little unclear to me what these mean).

# Lesson 82: なんて, なんか, など. 3 common words clarified

These words have rather wide meaning-spectrums, meaning that dictionaries cannot accurately cover all of their meanings, especially given they&rsquo;re used in such colloquial ways.

など essentially means what &rsquo;etcetera&rsquo; means in English. It is used both in completely formal writing and in totally casual speech. An example dictionary definition for 車窓:

> 車窓： 自動車​**など**​の窓 - 車窓： The window of an automobile etc.

In informal Japanese など also has another use that overlaps with the other two. It can be used to denigrate or belittle the word that it is attached to:

> タバコ​**など**​不要だ - I&rsquo;ve no use for cigarettes - I don&rsquo;t need that kind of thing

> タバコ​**は**​不要だ - I&rsquo;ve no use for cigarettes

-   Note: など displaces other particles and carries that more dismissive tone.

Both なんか and なんて can be used in this throwing-a-negative-light-on-the-noun-they-follow-way. The strongest and most colloquial is なんか, followed by なんて and then など which, as said we can use in formal contexts as well as casual.

なんか is really a contraction of なにか (something), but it has quite a few colloquial uses.

> お姉さん​**なんか**​大嫌い - I really hate stuff like my sister

Of course, she doesn&rsquo;t literally mean &rsquo;stuff like my sister&rsquo;, she means &rsquo;my sister&rsquo;, but using なんか adds this disparaging light.

It can be less disparaging:

> 雨​**なんか**​へいきだ - I&rsquo;m not bothered by rain

It is also often used towards oneself to stress an inferior or stressful position one finds oneself in:

> 私​**なんか**​まるで子供あつかいだ - I&rsquo;m treated just like a child

Don&rsquo;t forget, the fundamental meaning of なんか is just a contraction of なにか and can be used just as such:

> ​**なんか**​心配はある？ - Is there some worry? - Is anything worrying you?

It can also therefore be used to preface things:

> ​**なんか**​誓う - Something&rsquo;s different

And from there goes on to mean &rsquo;somehow&rsquo;:

> ​**なんか**​つきじゃない - Somehow I don&rsquo;t like it

From here it gets worse and becomes even vaguer. In very casual speech なんか can be heard at the start of the sentence and then several times throughout the sentence, なんか this and なんか that. When used in this way it&rsquo;s being used really like &rsquo;kinda&rsquo; or &rsquo;like&rsquo; in English, and just as in English this is a *sloppy* way of talking. It is not *good* Japanese just as &rsquo;like&rsquo; and &rsquo;kinda&rsquo; aren&rsquo;t good English.

なんて is essentially a contraction of 何って, which remember is itself a contraction of 何と or 何という.

In its simplest use it is used for saying:

> ​**なんて**​いった - What did you say?

English natives would be tempted to say 何をいった, but this is not natural Japanese.

なんて is also used as English &rsquo;what&rsquo; in both expressions and questions:

> ​**なんて**​美しい景色だ - What a beautiful scenery

It is also used as we discussed before in this belittling manner:

> 試験​**なんて**​嫌いだ - I hate exams

It can also be used at the end of a complete statement to express surprise (This is similar to the &rsquo;what a x&rsquo; we looked at just a moment ago):

> からを立てる​**なんて**​きみらしくない - Getting angry, that&rsquo;s not like you

Finally, we can use なんて like the original meaning of なにという, but adding a bit of vagueness:

> [Name]​**なんて**​人は知らない - I don&rsquo;t anyone called [Name]

# Lesson 83: Commanding in Japanese

Using the て-form can be an abbreviation of a command or request:

> ちょっと待って = ちょっと待ってください

This is casual, but because it abbreviates the &rsquo;please&rsquo; is also probably the least likely to be offensive.

Sometimes, instead of ちょっと待って you&rsquo;ll hear:

> ちょっと待ってて - Wait a little bit (and I&rsquo;ll be back) = ちょっと待っていて

-   Note: implication of the waiting period will end fairly shortly

As we know, ちょっと待っている means to exist in a state of waiting, ちょっと待っていて places ちょっと待っている and places it into the て-form, so what you&rsquo;re being asked to do is exist in a state of waiting.

The other thing to know about the て-form, is that the negative helper adjective ない has (as well as the normal て-form) an irregular て-form in ないで:

> 泣かないで - [Please] don&rsquo;t cry

This is only used for &rsquo;do be without doing a&rsquo; sentences, and in commands/requests, where it again abbreviates ください.

Next is なさい. なさい attaches to the い-stem of verbs:

-   おきなさい - Get/wake up
-   おちつきなさい - Settle/calm down

なさい is the sort of command given by parents to children, teachers to a class etc. It&rsquo;s not offensive if it&rsquo;s given by someone who&rsquo;s entitled to give it.

Something that can be confusing is an abbreviation of なさい, which means the opposite of something else with the same sound: な. When we attach な to the い-stem of a verb, then we&rsquo;re actually abbreviating なさい. In statements where な isn&rsquo;t attached to the い-stem however it means the opposite, to not do something:

> バカにするな! - Don&rsquo;t make fun of me!

> それをたべるな! - Don&rsquo;t eat that! (it could be poison)

This な attaches to entire logical clauses, not the the い-stem. This な is an older negative related to ない.

Finally, is the 命令形 or Command form (imperative). This is formed by using the bare え-stem of a verb, attaching nothing. For ichidan, replace the る with ろ.

> 黙れ - Be quiet! (This is more forceful and potentially more offensive than うるさい)

This form isn&rsquo;t inherently offensive if someone has the right to be giving orders, and people who talk rough among friends may use it. In anime it is common also. It can also express urgency:

> 助けてくれ! - Help me! (I really need it soon)

-   Note, this is almost exclusively used by men
-   Note, this くれ (from ください) is one of the only irregulars outside of する -> しろ and くる -> こい

---

For the sake of completeness there are two other ways of commanding, but these are mostly used for other things.

The first is the のだ/んだ ending placed onto a complete logical clause which has been covered previously. This ending has a wide range of uses, but one of them is a command.

Also, ように (covered in lesson 28) can form commands.


<a id="org26d630b"></a>

# Lesson 84: What older copulas tell us

であります, でごさる, でござる and どございます are all just forms of である. ござる is a outdated, polite form of ある. でございます is the keigo form used in shops and public announcements etc.

である could be considered the &rsquo;straight copula&rsquo;. だ sounds casual, です sounds polite, である is seen in all sorts of contexts where on is being objective.

である is also used for another reason. As we know, だ and です can only be used at the end of a logical clause and can&rsquo;t be used to (pre)modify a noun. If we want to modify a noun with another noun marked by the copula, we can only do that with an adjectival noun, because adjectival nouns can use な.

> 花がきれいだ - flower is pretty

> きれいな花 - pretty-is flower

If we want to use a copula marked noun as a modifier, and that noun isn&rsquo;t an adjectival noun, we must use である. This isn&rsquo;t very common, as we can usually use の, but in some cases either の doesn&rsquo;t work, or it just isn&rsquo;t something that we want to do.

Suppose we want to say &rsquo;Sakura, who is a university student&rsquo;:

> 大学生であるさくら - Sakura who is a university student

As opposed to:

> 大学生のさくら - University student Sakura

There are cases where we don&rsquo;t have a choice of which to use, for example, for state of beings:

> 円形であるさま - The state of being round

円形のさま doesn&rsquo;t really work here.

Historically, だ is an abbreviation of である, and です is an abbreviation of であります. There are some notes here on how all this works but I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s necessary.

# Lesson 85: まい the negative helper

まい is a negative helper like ず and ぬ and is a relative of まい. Like ぬ and ず it isn&rsquo;t quite at home in modern Japanese.

The first unusual thing about まい is that is doesn&rsquo;t attach to one of the verb stems, in most cases it attaches to the complete verb. It can attach to the universal ichidan stem but often attaches to the full ichidan verb too. くる and する have irregular forms in こまい and しまい but they can also be くるまい and するまい.

まい is a sister to ない. まい is the volitional form. Adjectives don&rsquo;t usually have volitional forms but in this case they do, and they have certain uses. まい is an adjective, but unlike any others it **does not** morph. There is no まくて or まかった or any other form, only the simple, unchanged form. This is actually the same as the (positive) volitional helper verb which also doesn&rsquo;t have a past form or a て-form etc.

What does the negative volitional actually do? It can&rsquo;t be used in all the same ways as the positive, it cannot be used as a call to action. It can&rsquo;t be used for constructions that mean &rsquo;try to do [something]&rsquo;.

It&rsquo;s most usual use is to express one&rsquo;s subjective doubt:

> そんあことはあるまい - Such a thing is most unlikely (to be)

> この振りではかれは来まい - In this downpour, I doubt if he&rsquo;ll come

This is rather similar to the other adjectives that have been covered that express subjectivities, such as ほしい and こわい. In this case it&rsquo;s out subjectivity about the likelihood of something.

It is also used, in a way that is directly equivalent to the positive volitional, which is to strongly assert negative intent:

> 二度と行くまい - I won&rsquo;t go there a second time - I won&rsquo;t go there again.

There are a couple of other positive constructions in which まい is used.

VようかVまいか is similar to ~かどうか but is restricted to verbs, and being volitional (will-based) is mostly used in relation to considering options.

Another is in the combined use of し which as we know combines reasons for things, but can be used at the end of a sentence to imply more reasons than just those stated:

> 金持ちではあるまいし - (It&rsquo;s) not that we might be rich or anything

> 世界が終わるわけがあるまいし - It isn&rsquo;t that the world might end of anything


<a id="org09ce26b"></a>

# Extra: Words that don&rsquo;t belong in modern Japanese

There are words from old Japanese that have survived into modern Japanese, but they don&rsquo;t work the way that they used to, and they don&rsquo;t work in the quite same manner that words in modern Japanese do either.

The せん of ません (the negative form of the polite helper verb ます) is one of these old Japanese words. Usually negatives are formed by attaching the helper adjective ない but with ます, but instead here with have せん which doesn&rsquo;t attach to the normal stem and doesn&rsquo;t work like any of the three main kinds of words, nouns, verbs and adjectives.

ぬ and ず are both negatives.

ぬ essentially works the same way as ない works in modern Japanese. You attach it to the あ-stem to form a negative. わからない == わからぬ. The peculiar thing is that these words despite seeming to be verbs don&rsquo;t have a て-form or modulate in any way.

ず works like ないで (the irregular て-form of ない). Again, it attaches to the あ-stem like ない and ぬ. It doesn&rsquo;t mean the ないで that can be a command or suggestion, it only means the ないで that means &rsquo;without doing A, do B&rsquo;:

> たべないでねた == たべずねた - I went to sleep without eating

While ず is often used in exactly the same way as ないで, ず can also be used with に:

> たべずにねた -

ず and ぬ do not work like verbs, they don&rsquo;t modulate. They also don&rsquo;t work like adjectives. For this reason they aren&rsquo;t 用言 (active words), i.e. they&rsquo;re (practically) nouns (in modern Japanese). Since it&rsquo;s adverbial, it can be treated like an adverbial noun.

# Lesson 86: 次第 (shidai)

しだい is another word that has many different definitions when translated into English. 次第 is made of two Kanji, and it&rsquo;s a noun (as we can tell from it being a word formed solely of kanji). The two kanji are 次 (next) and 第 (ordinal (number in sequence)). In English ordinal is the *st* in 1st, the *nd* in 2nd etc. In Japanese just 第 (だい) is used: 第3話 - 3rd episode.

What 次第 therefore means is &rsquo;next [thing] in sequence&rsquo;. It generally works by attaching to another noun, giving us a compound. The simplest usage of this is equivalent to the English expressions &rsquo;as soon as&rsquo;:

> 分かり次第お会話します - As soon as [it] becomes known, I&rsquo;ll call you - I&rsquo;ll call you as soon as I know

> 食事の用意が出来次第食べる - As soon as the preparations for the meal are complete we&rsquo;ll eat.

Note, here we have attached 次第 to the stem of 出来る.

From this same idea of &rsquo;next in sequence&rsquo;, we get this seemingly disparate English translation &rsquo;depending upon&rsquo;:

> それは天気次第だ - That follows directly from the weather - That depends on the weather

> 手当たり次第食べる - Hand touch is followed by eat - He eats whatever he puts his hands on

Another useful trick is that we can attach 次第 directly to a person:

> それはあなた次第です - That follow-from-you-thing is - It follows directly from you - It&rsquo;s up to you

According to:

> 値段は品次第で違う - Price differs directly following the goods - The price is according to the good&rsquo;s quality

> 身分次第に暮らす - Live according to one&rsquo;s means

In some cases 次第 meaning &rsquo;next in sequence&rsquo; can represent the whole sequence:

> それはこんな次第だった - It was this kind of situation - It was this kind of sequence of events

次第に is simply the practice of applying に to a noun to describe doing something adverbially. Doing something in a 次第 manner is to do it as a sequence of steps or gradually.

> チェシャー猫は次第に消えた - The cheshire cat disappeared gradually

The important note here, is that when 次第 is used by itself, i.e. it isn&rsquo;t joined to another noun, it means &rsquo;gradual&rsquo;, when it is joined to another noun, then it means &rsquo;X is next in sequence&rsquo;, regardless of if に is attached or not.


# Footnotes

<sup><a id="fn.1" href="#fnr.1">1</a></sup> In English the verb &rsquo;to be&rsquo; is irregular and has multiple forms be/is/are/am: To *be* walking, Sakura *is* walking, not Sakura *be* walking.

# Structure


<a id="org3dccd34"></a>

## Core sentence

Every sentence is formed of two elements, they are the が-marked noun and the *engine*.

In all languages there are only two kinds of sentence:

-   A **is** B i.e. Sakura is Japanese
-   A **does** B i.e. Sakura Walks

> さくらが日本人だ - Sakura is Japanese

> さくらが歩く - Sakura walks

There are three possible engines:

-   Verb - A does B
-   だ-marked noun - A is B
-   い-*&ldquo;Adjective&rdquo;*<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> - A is B

The engine **always** comes at the end of the sentence (with the exception of sentence ender particles<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>

<a id="orgd6aadf2"></a>
The が-marked noun is not always visible in the sentence. It is still present as part of the core of the sentence however. The closest English equivalent to this invisible が is &rsquo;it&rsquo;. Take this example English sentence:

> The ball rolled down the hill. When the ball got to the bottom the ball hit a sharp stone and the ball was punctured and all the air came out of the ball.

This is not a sentence we would ever say in English, once we have established that we are talking about &rsquo;the ball&rsquo; we would instead refer to the ball by &rsquo;it&rsquo;:

> The ball rolled down the hill. When it got to the bottom it hit a sharp stone and it was punctured and all the air came out of it.

If we were to completely omit &rsquo;it&rsquo; the sentence would still be easy to understand, we don&rsquo;t **need** to use this it marker each time, but English grammar **demands** it. Japanese does not, hence the &rsquo;invisible&rsquo; が carriage.

<a id="org93ce158"></a>
&rsquo;It&rsquo; by itself doesn&rsquo;t really mean anything, we know what it means from context. All of the pronouns I/it/we/he/they can be replaced by an invisible logical particle<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup> (most often が) marked *∅ pronoun*. It is important to remember that the が-marked noun **is still there**.

> [∅が]さくらだ - (I) am Sakura

By default &rsquo;I&rsquo; is the default value of this ∅ pronoun. However, if someone were introducing their daughter and said 「さくらだ」 we would understand from context that ∅ meant this/she.

> [∅が]土曜日だ - (Today) is Saturday
> It is Saturday - (Today) is Saturday

From context it is clear that ∅ and &rsquo;it&rsquo; mean &rsquo;today&rsquo;.


<a id="orgd9ec372"></a>

## Tense

In Japanese the tenses are not the same past, present and future tenses we&rsquo;re familiar with from English.


<a id="org7829f2e"></a>

### Non-past (future) tense

The basic, dictionary-form of verbs are in the *non-past* tense. The Japanese non-past tense is very similar to the English non-past tense. What is the *English* non-past tense? It is again the plain dictionary form of a verb: *eat*, *run*, *walk* etc. It is unnatural in English to say &rsquo;I eat cake&rsquo;, to mean &rsquo;I am eating cake&rsquo;. It is natural however to use the non-past tense to say &rsquo;Sometimes I eat cake&rsquo; or, in the explicitly future tense &rsquo;I will eat cake&rsquo;. Japanese is just the same as English in this way. It is rare we use this form for talking about things actually happening right now, except in cases like literary descriptions.

Just as the ∅ pronoun<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup> defaults to &rsquo;I&rsquo;, the non-past tense defaults to the future.

> さくらが歩く - Sakura will walk

> 犬がたべる - Dog will eat

&rsquo;Sakura walks&rsquo; is possible, but isn&rsquo;t the most natural way.


<a id="org77561f7"></a>

### Present (continuous)

In order to say something like &rsquo;Sakura is walking&rsquo; we need to combine the verb 「歩く」 - *to walk* with the verb 「いる」 -  *to be*. This is done by putting the verb into the て-form<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup>.

> さくらが歩いている - Sakura is walking

> 犬がたべている - Dog is eating

The core sentence here is &rsquo;Sakura is existing&rsquo;, the て-form verb, what we shall call a *secondary engine* which modifies the main engine. In what state is Sakura existing? She is existing in the state of eating.


<a id="orge6f677e"></a>

### Past

To form the past tense of a verb we need to take the verb stem<sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6">6</a></sup> and add た.

> 犬がたべた - The dog ate


<a id="orgb3023d8"></a>

### Time expressions

If we want to make it clear that we are talking about a future event we can add a time expression. By prefixing a sentence with あした (tomorrow), we can make it clear that what we will be doing, we will be doing tomorrow.

> あした∅がケーキをたべる - Tomorrow I will eat cake

Note how we simply preface the sentence with &rsquo;tomorrow&rsquo;, just like we would in English. This is the case with all *relative-time nouns*, &rsquo;yesterday&rsquo;, &rsquo;tomorrow&rsquo;, &rsquo;the day after tomorrow&rsquo;, &rsquo;next week&rsquo;, next month&rsquo;, &rsquo;next year&rsquo;.

For *non-relative*, i.e. *absolute* time expressions we must use the に-particle:

> 火曜日\*に\*∅がケーキをたべる - On Tuesday I will eat cake

We must attach に in all the same places we would attach on/in/at in English. &rsquo;On Tuesday&rsquo;, &rsquo;in March&rsquo;, &rsquo;at 12 o&rsquo;clock&rsquo;. Fortunately in Japanese we only need to use the one particle.


<a id="org7287559"></a>

## て-form

Japanese verbs fall into three groups: *Ichidan*, *Godan*, and *irregular*

The first group are *ichidan* (lit: one level) verbs. Morphing these verbs is easy, we simply remove the る and add our new ending. Ichidan verbs can only end in either いる or える (phonetically).

The second group is by far the largest, the *godan* (lit: five level) verbs. This group contains verbs that end in all of the possible verb endings: う つ る ー ぬ ぶ む ー く ぐ ー す. Each of these ending groups has its own way of being morphed, though although they&rsquo;re &rsquo;five level&rsquo; verbs, two of the groups use the same method so we only need to learn 4 methods. Confusingly this means that godan verbs can end in いる or える, most of these will still be *ichidan* verbs, and fortunately even if a verb is morphed incorrectly, you will probably still be understood.

-   う つ る -> って
-   ぬ ぶ む -> んで
-   く/ぐ -> いて/いで (Note: this is the combined group)
-   す -> して

There are only two irregular verbs, くる and する. いく, is partly irregular, but not completely.

-   くる -> きて
-   する -> して
-   いく -> いって (<del>いいて</del>)

These are the only exceptions


<a id="org8f5cf41"></a>

## Adjectives

Japanese adjectives are not the same as English adjectives. As we have learned Japanese sentences come in three kinds, depending on the type of engine they have. All three of these engines can be used like adjectives.

-   Verb<sup><a id="fnr.7" class="footref" href="#fn.7">7</a></sup> - A **does** B
-   だ-marked noun<sup><a id="fnr.8" class="footref" href="#fn.8">8</a></sup> - A **is** B
-   い-*&ldquo;Adjective&rdquo;*[fn::[1.4.1](#org5b65ea8)) - A **is** B


<a id="org5b65ea8"></a>

### い-adjectives

Let&rsquo;s start with the first one, the one we refer to as an adjective in English, the い-engine:

> ぺんがあかい - Pen is red

An important note, 「あかい」 does not mean &rsquo;red&rsquo;, it means &rsquo;is red&rsquo;. 「あか」 means red.

If we swap the order of 「ぺんが」 and 「あかい」 then we can take this い-engine, and now use it not as the primary engine, but as a secondary engine. This would not be a complete sentence however without a new engine, for example, a new (primary) い engine.

> あかいぺんがちいさい - Red pen is small


<a id="org922bc76"></a>

### Verb-adjectives

Any verb in any tense can be used like an adjective:

> しょうじょがうたった - Girl sang

> うたったしょうじょが&#x2026; - The girl who sang&#x2026; (Note: this sentence is not yet complete, it lacks a primary engine).

> うたったしょうじょがねている - The girl who sang is sleeping

Verbal adjectives can create very complex sentences in which we can use entire other-sentences (clauses) in an adjectival manner.


<a id="org1a5c6b6"></a>

### Noun-adjectives

<a id="org7fa7ffe"></a>

> いぬがやんちゃだ - The dog is naughty

We can turn 「やんちゃ」 into an adjective too, but there is one important thing to note. Just as we have to add だ to a noun to use it as an engine, here we must add な to the noun to use it as an adjective. な is in fact the connective form of だ. Don&rsquo;t be fooled by so-called &rsquo;な-adjectives&rsquo;, they&rsquo;re simply nouns! *Adjectival* nouns.

> やんちゃないぬが&#x2026; - The dog who is naughty&#x2026; (Note: this sentence is not yet complete, it lacks a primary engine).

> やんちゃないぬがねている - The dog who is naughty is sleeping

An important note is that we cannot do this with *all* nouns, only nouns which are frequently used in an adjectival way. This group of nouns is what are referred to as &rsquo;な-adjectives&rsquo;. We can use all nouns as adjectives, but for the rest we need to use a different technique, *の-adjectives*<sup><a id="fnr.9" class="footref" href="#fn.9">9</a></sup>.

<a id="org1de7981"></a>

# Particles

No particles other than が and だ can ever be part of the core sentence<sup><a id="fnr.10" class="footref" href="#fn.10">10</a></sup> and only が is present in every sentence (even if invisible<sup><a id="fnr.11" class="footref" href="#fn.11">11</a></sup>.


<a id="orgfb1bb8d"></a>

## Logical particles

All logical particles attach to nouns, they **cannot** attach to anything but nouns.


<a id="org449daab"></a>

### TODO が (*ga*) - Subject <a id="orgd1d588e"></a>


<a id="orgd8f80b7"></a>

### TODO だ <a id="org9de4b68"></a>


<a id="org8c2f8eb"></a>

### を (*o/wo*) - (Direct) Object

The を particle marks the object of the sentence, the *thing* that some verb (the engine) is being done to. が marks the thing that is doing the verb.

> わたし\*が\*ケエキ\*を\*たべる - I eat cake

The core sentence here is &rsquo;I eat&rsquo;. The extra を particle marked noun, is telling us more about the engine (eat). *What* are we eating? We are eating cake.

> わたしがぼーるをなげる - I threw the ball

The core sentence is &rsquo;I threw&rsquo;, and the extra を particle marked noun tells us what we threw i.e. the ball.


<a id="org99297ce"></a>

### に (*ni*) - Target (Indirect Object)

The に-particle marks the target (indirect object) of an engine. Along with が and を:

-   が tells us who does the doing
-   を tells us what it is done to
-   に tells us what the ultimate target of that doing

> わたしがぼーるをさくら\*に\*なげる - I threw the ball at/to Sakura

Sakura is the destination, the target. It is important to note here that the logical particles tell us what happened. The order of the words doesn&rsquo;t really matter the way it does in English.

> わたし\*に\*さくらがぼーるをなげる - Sakura threw the ball at/to me.

> ぼーるがわたし\*に\*さくらをなげる - The ball throws Sakura at me

Obviously this final example doesn&rsquo;t make any sense (although we might want to say something nonsensical like this in a fantasy novel or something) but we can say whatever we like in Japanese so long as we use the right logical particles.

See also use of に in *time expressions*<sup><a id="fnr.12" class="footref" href="#fn.12">12</a></sup>.


<a id="org3ffcea9"></a>

### の (*no*) - Possessive

The の particle, or the *possessive particle* functions just like the English *&rsquo;s*.

> さくら\*の\*はな - Sakura&rsquo;s nose

> わたし\*の\*はな - Me&rsquo;s (my) nose

Luckily in Japanese we don&rsquo;t have to worry about his/her/my/their, we just use の.

<a id="org3e326f5"></a>
Because this is the *possessive particle* we can use this in another slightly different way. 「あか」 has an *adjectival* form in 「あかい」, but not all colours have this form. The Japanese for pink, 「ピンクいる」 (lit: pink-colour) doesn&rsquo;t have an adjectival form in 「ピンクいろい」, nor can we use it as a secondary engine with な. So what are we to do? Well we can use the の-particle:

> ピンクいる\*の\*どれすが - The pink dress (literally: The dress belonging to the class of pink things)

> うさぎ\*の\*OSCAR - Oscar the rabbit (literally: Oscar belonging to the class of rabbit)


<a id="orgf7df448"></a>

## Non-logical particles

Non-logical particles are not part of the logical structure of a sentence. They are neither the thing we are saying something about, nor what we are saying about it. They also do not tell us more about the engine of the sentence as the other logical particles do.


<a id="org7def562"></a>

### は *wa*

The は-particle can be thought of as a *flag*. It simply marks something as the topic of the sentence, but doesn&rsquo;t say anything about it.

An exact translation of the は particle would be &rsquo;As for *x*&rsquo;. 「わたしは」 therefore means &rsquo;As for me&rsquo;, **not** &rsquo;I am&rsquo; (わたしが).

A commonly mistranslated sentence is:

> わたしは日本人だ - <del>I am Japanese</del>

Referring back to the core sentence<sup><a id="fnr.13" class="footref" href="#fn.13">13</a></sup> we can see that the が-marked noun so we don&rsquo;t actually know who or what the subject is. One may ask *&rsquo;well why don&rsquo;t we just treat the は particle as if it is marking the subject&rsquo;*. In this example it is obvious that the topic marked by は is the same as the subject marked by が, but there are many more cases where this is not true, leading to much confusion down the road. Let&rsquo;s look at a similar sentence. You are at a restaurant, the waitress is asking what you would like:

> わたしはうなぎだ - <del>I am an eel</del>

Treating は as &rsquo;I am&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t work. As we now know the default value of the ∅ pronoun is &rsquo;I&rsquo;, but in this context it&rsquo;s clear that we&rsquo;re talking instead about *what* we want to eat. 「わたしはうなぎだ」 therefore means &rsquo;As for me, eel&rsquo;.

> わたしは[∅が]日本人だ - As for me, (I) am Japanese

> わたしは[∅が]うなぎだ - As for me, (what I would like to order) is eel

> わたし\*は\*[∅が]さくらにぼーるをなける - As for me, (I) threw the ball at Sakura

> ぼーるはわたしがさくらに[∅を]なける - As for the ball, I threw (it) at Sakura

This time the を marked noun (not the が marked noun) has become invisible<sup><a id="fnr.14" class="footref" href="#fn.14">14</a></sup>, because what we&rsquo;re throwing is now marked by the は particle, ∅ here has taken the value of &rsquo;it&rsquo;. Even without は we might already know what &rsquo;it&rsquo; was that was thrown from context. The important thing to understand here is that as we change the logical particles from one noun to another we change the meaning of the sentence, but when we change the non-logical particle は from one noun to another it makes no difference to the logic of the sentence. It may make some difference to the emphasis, but it makes no difference to who is doing what or what they&rsquo;re doing it to.
